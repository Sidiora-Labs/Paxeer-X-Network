#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Deploys the PaxeerXVault of one EVM chain of the Paxeer X Network bridge from
# that chain's configuration and nothing else, then reads the deployment back
# and writes a record of it.
#
# Usage:
#   deploy-evm-chain.sh [--preflight] <chain>
#   deploy-evm-chain.sh [--preflight] --all
#
# --all deploys the eight EVM chains in order - ethereum, base, arbitrum,
# optimism, bnb, polygon, avalanche, hyperevm - stopping at the first that
# fails, each writing $PAXEER_BRIDGE_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD_DIR/<chain>.json.
#
# BRIDGE_DEPLOY_OVERLAY names the private deploy overlay that fills in the owner,
# the deployer, the attestors, the environment variable names and the caps of
# each chain (bridge/deploy/overlay.jq applies it). On hyperevm the overlay's
# big_blocks_acknowledged records the step that comes before the deployment:
# the deploying account is switched to big blocks on Hyperliquid
# (evmUserModify usingBigBlocks=true), because the vault deployment does not fit
# in a small block. Without that acknowledgement hyperevm is refused.
#
# The chain name is the directory under bridge/evm/chains. --preflight runs
# every check that needs no endpoint - the configuration, the environment
# variables it names and the tools it needs - and stops before the first call to
# the chain, so a deployment can be rehearsed offline. The sources and the
# pinned libraries are checked where they are used, when the deployment runs.
#
# Inputs, all through environment variables and never through a literal in this
# script or in the configuration:
#   the variable the configuration names in environment.rpc_url      the endpoint
#   the variable the configuration names in environment.deploy_key   the deployer key
#   PAXEER_BRIDGE_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD   where the deployment record is written
#   PAXEER_BRIDGE_EVM_CHAINS_ROOT     optional chains root, for a run-local
#                                     configuration under <root>/<chain>/config.json
#
# The configuration is the only source of the chain id, the owner, the attestor
# set, the threshold and the caps. Every placeholder, every missing variable,
# every chain id the endpoint does not confirm and every deployed code hash that
# is not the built one stops the run. There is no default endpoint, key, owner
# or address anywhere in this script.
#
# The endpoint reaches cast through ETH_RPC_URL rather than a command argument.
# The pinned foundry offers no environment variable and no standard-input path
# for a raw deploy key, and importing one into a keystore needs a terminal, so
# the key reaches exactly one command - the broadcasting forge script - as an
# argument; run a deployment only where process arguments are not readable by
# another user, or hand foundry a keystore out of band.
#
# bridge/deploy/chainconfig is the schema of a configuration and the authority
# on what a valid one looks like; its Go tests assert every committed file. The
# checks below are the deployment preconditions this script refuses to deploy
# without, enforced where a deployment happens.

# Offline check of the three deployment scripts of the Paxeer X Network bridge:
# bridge/deploy/deploy-evm-chain.sh, bridge/deploy/verify-evm-chain.sh and
# bridge/deploy/deploy-solana-program.sh.
#
# Every committed chain configuration is refused while it carries its
# placeholder owner and attestor set, a configuration whose placeholders are
# filled in with values generated for this run is accepted by --preflight, and
# every argument, placeholder, missing variable, unreadable file and inconsistent
# deployment record is refused with a message that names the field or the
# variable at fault.
#
# No endpoint, explorer or cluster is reached: the endpoint variables carry the
# reserved .invalid domain, and the keys and identities are generated into a
# private temporary directory and thrown away with it. The Solana run is driven
# as far as the pinned toolchain, which this check points at an empty directory:
# that refusal is the proof that every configuration and environment check before
# it passed. The Solana first deployment is then driven past --preflight against
# the cluster recorded in fixtures/solana-deploy, whose toolchain answers only the
# invocations the script makes and only for a .invalid endpoint: the vault
# authority the script records must be the PDA of the seed the program declares
# as VAULT_SEED, derived by the arithmetic the bridge/vectors Solana vector pins,
# a script that names any other seed is caught, and a placeholder
# solana.program_id stops the run before the initialise step. The program keypair
# a first deployment generates is kept beside the deployment record, named by it
# and never overwritten, and the repeated run with the filled program id deploys
# with it and reaches the initialise step. The run waits for the deployed program
# to be executable past its deploy slot and stops naming the program when it is
# not. The platform tools release the Solana script declares must be no older
# than the first whose cargo accepts edition 2024, it must reach cargo-build-sbf
# as --tools-version, and every cargo build-sbf the bridge workflow runs must name
# the same release. A deployment against a real cluster is the Solana dry run's
# job, not this check's. The EVM deployment is driven from a directory other than
# bridge/evm, against stand-ins for forge, cast and git that answer only the
# invocations the script makes, in a copy of the tree whose script is the
# committed one byte for byte, and it finds the Foundry script from there.

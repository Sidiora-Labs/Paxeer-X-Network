# Paxeer X Network bridge

The Paxeer X Network bridge is lock and release in both directions: a foreign chain locks a deposit in the bridge's vault and Paxeer X Network releases the bridged denom through the layerxBridge precompile at `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016` against a threshold of attestor signatures, and a burn of that denom on Paxeer X Network is attested so the foreign vault releases what it holds. The default pair on every chain is PAX against that chain's native coin, and SID - Sidiora, the second official coin - bridges between Paxeer X Network and Solana, its foreign home.

This page is the operator runbook: what to deploy, in what order, with which environment variables, and what must read back before the bridge is opened. The Paxeer side is finished and the bridge configures it; nothing in these steps changes the chain. The product site is [paxeer.app](https://paxeer.app) and the source is [the Paxeer X Network repository](https://github.com/Sidiora-Labs/Paxeer-X-Network).

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `bridge/evm` | the Foundry project of `PaxeerXVault`, one source deployed as identical bytecode to every EVM chain |
| `bridge/evm/chains/<name>` | one `config.json` and one page per EVM chain |
| `bridge/solana` | the Solana custody program, a raw `solana-program` crate |
| `bridge/solana/chains/solana` | the Solana `config.json` and its page |
| `bridge/deploy` | the configuration schema, the proposal generator, the attestor-set manifest and the deploy and verify scripts |
| `bridge/vectors` | the Solana handle derivation and the pinned digest vectors |

## The chains

| Chain | Chain id | Pair | Page |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ethereum` | `1` | PAX against ETH | `bridge/evm/chains/ethereum/README.md` |
| `base` | `8453` | PAX against ETH | `bridge/evm/chains/base/README.md` |
| `arbitrum` | `42161` | PAX against ETH | `bridge/evm/chains/arbitrum/README.md` |
| `optimism` | `10` | PAX against ETH | `bridge/evm/chains/optimism/README.md` |
| `bnb` | `56` | PAX against BNB | `bridge/evm/chains/bnb/README.md` |
| `polygon` | `137` | PAX against POL | `bridge/evm/chains/polygon/README.md` |
| `avalanche` | `43114` | PAX against AVAX | `bridge/evm/chains/avalanche/README.md` |
| `hyperevm` | `999` | PAX against HYPE | `bridge/evm/chains/hyperevm/README.md` |
| `solana` | `91600046870081` | PAX against SOL, and SID | `bridge/solana/chains/solana/README.md` |

The native coin is the first asset of every configuration and is always registered: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` with eighteen decimals on an EVM chain, deposited through `depositNative`, and the wrapped SOL mint `So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112` with nine decimals on Solana. Every chain differs from the others only in its configuration file.

## Tools

| Tool | Needed by |
| --- | --- |
| `git` | `bridge/evm/bootstrap-libs.sh` |
| `jq`, `forge`, `cast` | `bridge/deploy/deploy-evm-chain.sh`, `bridge/deploy/verify-evm-chain.sh` |
| `jq`, `python3`, `cast`, `sha256sum` and the pinned Solana toolchain | `bridge/deploy/deploy-solana-program.sh` |
| `go` | the proposal generator under `bridge/deploy/proposals` |

## Fill in the configuration

Every committed configuration carries values nobody has filled in, and every tool refuses them, naming the file and the field. Nothing defaults.

- `owner` is `PLACEHOLDER:owner` in every configuration: the vault owner address on an EVM chain, the program owner's base58 key on Solana.
- `attestors` are `PLACEHOLDER:attestor-1` to `PLACEHOLDER:attestor-5` in every configuration, at a threshold of `3`. There is one attestor set for the whole bridge: fill in the same five secp256k1 addresses, strictly ascending, everywhere.
- `bridge/deploy/attestors.json` is the attestor-set manifest, the one committed record of the attestor addresses and the threshold. It carries the repeated-byte addresses `0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111` to `0x5555555555555555555555555555555555555555`, which the proposal generator refuses; it also refuses a configuration whose set or threshold differs from the manifest.
- `big_blocks.acknowledged` is `false` in `bridge/evm/chains/hyperevm/config.json`. The HyperEVM page says what to do before setting it to `true`.
- `solana.program_id` is `PLACEHOLDER:program-id` until the first Solana deployment prints the real id.

## Order of operations

### 1. Bootstrap the libraries

```sh
bash bridge/evm/bootstrap-libs.sh
```

Clones `forge-std` `v1.9.6` and `openzeppelin-contracts` `v5.3.0` into the `lib` directory beside `bridge/evm/foundry.toml`, which is never committed. A second run with both libraries already at their tag and unmodified does nothing; an edited checkout is replaced. The deploy script runs this itself before it builds.

### 2. Deploy each EVM chain

| Variable | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| the variable in `environment.rpc_url`, `PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL` | the chain's endpoint |
| the variable in `environment.deploy_key`, `PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_DEPLOY_KEY` | the deployer key |
| `PAXEER_BRIDGE_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD` | the path the deployment record is written to; its directory must exist and be writable |
| `PAXEER_BRIDGE_EVM_CHAINS_ROOT` | optional; a chains root in place of `bridge/evm/chains` |

```sh
bash bridge/deploy/deploy-evm-chain.sh --preflight <chain>
bash bridge/deploy/deploy-evm-chain.sh <chain>
```

`--preflight` runs every check that needs no endpoint - the configuration, the variables it names and the tools - and stops before the first call to the chain. The deployment then confirms the endpoint's chain id against the configuration, builds with the pinned libraries, deploys `PaxeerXVault` with the attestor set and threshold, sets the caps of every asset the configuration lists, and proposes ownership to the configured owner. It reads the deployed code, owner, threshold, attestors and caps back, stops if the code hash is not the built one or the threshold, the attestors or a cap differs from the configuration, and writes a record naming the chain, the vault address, the deployer, the code hash, the block, the owner, the ownership state, the threshold, the attestors and the caps.

Ownership moves in two steps. Until the configured owner calls `acceptOwnership()` on the vault, the deployer is still the owner and the record reads `"ownership": "proposed"`.

The deploy key reaches `forge script` as a command argument, so run a deployment only where another user cannot read process arguments.

A vault accepts deposits as soon as it exists: it starts unpaused with its caps set. Until the Paxeer side reads back as registered for the chain, the owner can hold it with `pause()`.

### 3. Verify the source

| Variable | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| the variable in `environment.explorer_key`, `PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_EXPLORER_KEY` | the explorer verification key |
| `PAXEER_BRIDGE_DEPLOYMENT_RECORD` | the record step 2 wrote |

```sh
bash bridge/deploy/verify-evm-chain.sh --preflight <chain>
bash bridge/deploy/verify-evm-chain.sh <chain>
```

The vault address and the constructor arguments come from the deployment record, so a source cannot be claimed for a deployment that was never made. The script submits through `forge verify-contract` and reports the explorer's own answer; anything other than a verified or already-verified answer stops it.

### 4. Deploy and initialise the Solana program

```sh
bash bridge/deploy/deploy-solana-program.sh --preflight
bash bridge/deploy/deploy-solana-program.sh
```

The Solana page, `bridge/solana/chains/solana/README.md`, lists the variables this step needs - the endpoint, the publisher keypair file, the pinned toolchain directory, the deployment record and the program's admin client - and what each must hold. The script builds the program with `cargo-build-sbf`, deploys it, checks the upgrade authority, the deployed ELF hash and that the deployment is rooted, initialises the program with the owner, the attestor set and the threshold, registers the wrapped SOL mint and then the Sidiora mint with their caps, and writes the deployment record.

Two things the Solana page covers in full: the admin client the script calls is not part of this repository, and the vault handle Paxeer registers for Solana comes from the seed `vault-authority`, not from the `vault_handle` field of the record.

### 5. Generate the proposals

```sh
go run ./bridge/deploy/proposals/cmd/paxeer-bridge-proposals -manifest bridge/deploy/attestors.json -proposals <proposals directory> <proposal input> <output directory>
```

`-manifest` defaults to `bridge/deploy/attestors.json`. The generator reads one chain's proposal input and the manifest, and writes the message bodies into an empty or absent output directory, in the order the proposals carry them:

| File | Body |
| --- | --- |
| `01-register-chain.json` | `MsgRegisterChain`: the chain id, the vault - on Solana the vault handle - and the finality depth, with the chain enabled |
| `02-set-attestors.json` | `MsgSetAttestors`: the shared attestor set and the threshold |
| `03-set-cap-<NN>-<asset id>.json` | one `MsgSetCap` per asset, the native coin first; for Solana, `SID` under `0x21f7b20a555199fa73A238B1a91FD0f549068fEe` |

Given `-proposals`, it also writes the governance proposals into a second empty or absent directory, which must not be the output directory:

| File | Proposal |
| --- | --- |
| `04-proposal-open-chain.json` | the proposal that opens the chain: `MsgRegisterChain`, `MsgSetAttestors` and every `MsgSetCap` except Sidiora's, in the order of the bodies, the native coin's cap first |
| `05-proposal-sidiora-cap.json` | Solana only: `MsgRegisterSidioraPair`, which records the Sidiora pair against `usid`, and then Sidiora's `MsgSetCap`, in that order, in a proposal of its own |

Each file is the content of one governance proposal as a transaction carries it: a `BridgeProposal` under the type URL `/paxprotocol.paxchain.layerxbridge.BridgeProposal`, with its title, its description and every message packed under its own type URL. The proposals are written apart from the bodies because the checklist counts every JSON file in the bodies directory.

Every body and every proposal is marshalled from the message types in `modules/layerxbridge/types`, so it cannot drift from what the keeper accepts. The generator refuses a placeholder or zero authority, owner, vault or attestor, a zero threshold or one above the attestor count, a zero cap, and a set that differs from the manifest, and it writes nothing when it refuses.

The proposal input is a JSON file in the generator's own schema, decoded with unknown fields refused: `name`, `chain_id`, `native_symbol`, `native_decimals`, `rpc_endpoint_env`, `explorer_key_env`, `governance_authority`, `owner`, `vault`, `attestors`, `threshold`, `finality_depth`, `program_id`, `commitment`, `big_blocks_required` and `assets`, each asset carrying `address`, `asset_id`, `decimals`, `max_per_tx` and `max_total`. It is not the chain configuration file: the generator refuses the configuration's own fields. Write it from three sources - the chain configuration for the chain, the attestors, the finality depth and the assets with their caps; the deployment record for `vault`; and the bridge authority for `governance_authority`. `bridge/deploy/proposals/testdata/ethereum.json` and `bridge/deploy/proposals/testdata/solana.json` show the shape.

`governance_authority` is the bech32 account of the governance module, the authority a governance proposal executes with; the generator refuses any other account. The keeper applies each message only when its authority is that account.

### 6. Submit the proposals

The bodies reach the chain inside governance proposals. Submit `04-proposal-open-chain.json` as the content of one governance proposal; it carries `01-register-chain.json`, `02-set-attestors.json` and the `03-set-cap-*` bodies in their numbered order, Sidiora's excepted. For Solana, submit `05-proposal-sidiora-cap.json` as a second proposal once the first has passed: it carries `MsgRegisterSidioraPair` ahead of Sidiora's `MsgSetCap`, so the proposal itself registers the pair against `usid` before it caps it, as the Sidiora section below explains.

When a proposal passes, the governance module account executes it through the application's `layerxbridge` proposal route: `NewProposalHandler` in `modules/layerxbridge/handler.go` runs every message it carries, in order, through the bridge module's message service and so through the keeper. It refuses a proposal carrying a message for any authority other than the governance module account, and if one message fails none of them changes the state.

Submit each proposal with the node's governance submit command, `paxd tx gov submit-proposal`, through its bridge subcommand, `layerxbridge-proposal [proposal-file]`, with the generated file as its argument, the initial deposit in `--deposit` and the proposer as the signer `--from` names:

```
paxd tx gov submit-proposal layerxbridge-proposal <proposals directory>/04-proposal-open-chain.json --deposit <coins> --from <key> --chain-id <chain id>
paxd tx gov submit-proposal layerxbridge-proposal <proposals directory>/05-proposal-sidiora-cap.json --deposit <coins> --from <key> --chain-id <chain id>
```

The subcommand, `BridgeProposalHandler` in `modules/layerxbridge/client/cli/tx.go`, reads the file exactly as the generator writes it and refuses a file with an unknown or a missing field, a proposal the route above would refuse, and a missing deposit.

### 7. Read the deployment back

The bridge is opened only when every value below reads back as the configuration and the generated bodies say, with the native coin checked first on every chain. A read changes nothing anywhere.

On each EVM chain, against the vault address in the deployment record:

```sh
cast code <vault> --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
cast call <vault> 'owner()(address)' --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
cast call <vault> 'attestors()(address[])' --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
cast call <vault> 'threshold()(uint256)' --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
cast call <vault> 'caps(address)(uint256,uint256)' <asset> --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
cast call <vault> 'paused()(bool)' --rpc-url "$PAXEER_BRIDGE_<CHAIN>_RPC_URL"
```

`cast keccak` of the code must equal the record's `code_hash`; the owner must be the configured owner, not the deployer; the attestors and threshold must be the manifest's; every asset, the native coin first, must carry the configured per-transaction and total cap; and `paused` must be `false`.

On Solana, read the config account (seed `config`) and every asset account (seed `asset` and the mint) of the program with `solana account`; their layouts are in `bridge/solana/src/state.rs`. The owner, the attestors, the threshold and the paused flag must match the configuration, and each asset account must carry its mint, its asset id and its caps, wrapped SOL first.

On Paxeer X Network, through the layerxBridge precompile:

```sh
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016 'getChain(uint64)(bool,address,uint64,bool)' <chain id> --rpc-url <Paxeer X Network EVM endpoint>
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016 'getAttestors()(address[],uint256[],uint32)' --rpc-url <Paxeer X Network EVM endpoint>
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016 'getCap(uint64,address)(string,uint256,uint256,uint256)' <chain id> <asset id> --rpc-url <Paxeer X Network EVM endpoint>
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016 'isPaused()(bool)' --rpc-url <Paxeer X Network EVM endpoint>
```

`getChain` must report the chain registered and enabled with the vault - on Solana the vault handle - and the finality depth of `01-register-chain.json`. `getAttestors` must return the manifest's set and threshold. `getCap` must return a denom and the `max_in_flight` and `max_per_tx` of each cap body, the native coin first; an empty denom means the asset is not registered. `isPaused` must be `false`.

Any disagreement, any placeholder still in place, an unregistered or uncapped native coin, a paused vault, program or precompile, or a chain the Paxeer side does not report as registered keeps the bridge closed.

## Outbound admission and coordinated cap changes

For each registered chain and asset, Paxeer's `max_per_tx` admission cap must be no greater than the active foreign release cap, in the same asset base units. `BridgeOut` checks that registered cap before debiting or burning, changing in-flight supply, issuing a nonce or emitting the burn. A missing or zero cap admits no positive burn. Deposits that individually fit the cap do not permit their combined balance to be burned above it; an amount exactly at the cap is admissible when the other checks pass. Reading and reconciling both caps is an owner/governance opening condition, not an automatic cross-chain update.

The cap-change contract is ordered:

1. Before a decrease, governance pauses Paxeer bridge admission. Wait for that pause to finalize and inventory every finalized burn through the pause height, keyed by chain, Paxeer transaction hash and outbound nonce, with its original asset, recipient and amount. Reconcile each item with the relayer journal and the foreign nullifier. Keep the foreign release path open at its existing cap while these pending obligations drain.
2. Governance lowers the Paxeer cap to the proposed value first. The foreign owner must not lower the release cap below any already-authorized, unresolved burn. Complete those releases under the old foreign cap and record their finalized release and consumed nullifier before lowering the foreign cap. If an obligation cannot be resolved, retain the old foreign cap and keep admission paused; a cap change never cancels it.
3. After the foreign decrease finalizes, read both values back and confirm `Paxeer max_per_tx <= foreign release cap`. Governance may then unpause admission. For an increase, the foreign owner raises and finalizes the release cap first; governance raises the Paxeer cap only after readback confirms the same inequality. Pauses and cap updates retain the existing owner and governance authority checks.

An existing burn blocked by a prematurely reduced cap needs an explicit operator-visible resolution record linked to the immutable journal item, not a replacement attestation. Record `cap-blocked` with the original amount, active foreign cap, failed transaction or observation, responsible owner and intended corrective cap action. Keep its resolution visible as `awaiting-owner-cap-restoration`, then `release-submitted`, and only `released` after finalized foreign evidence and the once-only nullifier confirm payment. These are required coordination-record states; they do not add or rename relayer journal variants. The journal already retains submitted, reverted/dropped or failed releases and completed releases in `interop/crates/layerx-bridge-relayer/src/journal.rs`; preserve those records across restart and link them to the resolution record. Never report a failed or merely submitted release as paid.

The owner may restore enough release capacity to settle the original authorized amount, then repeat the coordinated decrease. Do not rewrite the amount, split one burn into multiple attestations, reset its nonce, discard its pending record, or bypass its nullifier. `bridge/evm/src/PaxeerXVault.sol::release` and `bridge/solana/src/release.rs` with `state.rs::Asset::withdraw` continue enforcing the release cap, available custody, fixed attested amount and once-only burn identity. A transport retry may carry the same attestation in a replacement transaction under the existing retry rules; it cannot change the economic obligation.

## The Sidiora pair on Solana

An inbound SID deposit from Solana resolves to the `usid` denom only if the Paxeer side records the pair (`91600046870081`, `0x21f7b20a555199fa73A238B1a91FD0f549068fEe`) against `usid` before any cap is set for it.

- `MsgSetCap` for a pair the Paxeer side has not registered registers it itself, under the bridge's generic denom `factory/<bridge module account>/lxb<hex>`, not under `usid`. Submitting Sidiora's cap body first binds Solana's SID to the wrong denom, and `EnsureSidioraDenom` then refuses to rebind it.
- `MsgRegisterSidioraPair` registers the pair against `usid`. The keeper executes it through `EnsureSidioraDenom` in `modules/layerxbridge/keeper/sidiora.go`, for the governance authority only, and refuses it for any chain but `91600046870081`, Solana, Sidiora's foreign home. It needs the chain registered, and registering the pair again changes nothing.

The ordering rule is carried by the proposal itself. `05-proposal-sidiora-cap.json` carries `MsgRegisterSidioraPair` first and Sidiora's `MsgSetCap` second, and a proposal executes whole or not at all, so the cap can only land on the pair the same proposal has just recorded against `usid`. The generator writes it for Solana only and refuses Sidiora's asset id on any other chain.

So, for Solana: submit `04-proposal-open-chain.json`, which registers the chain, installs the attestors and sets the wrapped SOL cap without Sidiora's. Once it has passed, submit `05-proposal-sidiora-cap.json`; submitted earlier, it fails because the chain is not registered yet, and changes nothing. Once it has passed, read the pair back:

```sh
cast call 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001016 'getCap(uint64,address)(string,uint256,uint256,uint256)' 91600046870081 0x21f7b20a555199fa73A238B1a91FD0f549068fEe --rpc-url <Paxeer X Network EVM endpoint>
```

The denom it returns must be `factory/pax1dzfx9mk4fl9kl2mysjmtvk2xp75ljumk6nynhf/usid`, the `usid` denom of the bridge module account, with the caps of the proposal. A denom ending in `lxb` followed by hex means a cap for the pair was set by something other than this proposal before it, and the proposal's registration of the pair is then refused.

## Deposit recipients

Paxeer X Network mints an inbound deposit only to a nonzero EVM address left-padded to 32 bytes, `bytes32(uint256(uint160(address)))`: `RecipientAddress` in `modules/layerxbridge/types/attestation.go` is the rule, `Keeper.BridgeIn` refuses any other `paxeerRecipient`, and the relayer refuses to attest one. `PaxeerXVault` applies the same rule in `deposit` and `depositNative` before anything moves: a recipient with a nonzero high twelve bytes, or with a zero low twenty bytes, reverts with `InvalidRecipient()`, so no balance, `outstanding`, `depositNonce` or `BridgeDeposit` changes. Every accepted recipient reaches `BridgeDeposit`, the inbound digest, the relayer and `Keeper.BridgeIn` byte for byte; the selectors, the event and both digest layouts are the ones `modules/layerxbridge/ATTESTATION.md` specifies.

A vault deployed before this rule is not upgradeable and keeps accepting the other encodings. A deposit it accepted with a recipient Paxeer refuses is locked in that vault: it counts against the asset's total cap, the relayer journals it as refused and attests nothing, and the keeper mints nothing for it. No path of the vault returns it - `release` needs an attested Paxeer burn and `rescue` refuses every registered asset and the native coin. Every such deposit is reported, by chain, vault, transaction hash and log index, as requiring an explicit recovery disposition decided by the bridge authority. Neither the relayer, an attestor nor the keeper rewrites the signed recipient bytes to another address or credits anyone on Paxeer for it; a recovery happens only as that authorized disposition, never as a bridge mint.

## The relayer

`interop/crates/layerx-bridge-relayer` observes the vaults, has the attestations signed through the remote signer and submits both directions. It runs as `layerx-bridge-relayer --config <path>` against one JSON file, decoded with unknown fields refused: `journal_path`, an optional `cosign_directory`, `poll_interval_ms`, `max_submissions`, `signer`, `attestor`, `paxeer` and `chains`. Each `chains` entry carries `chain_id`, `vault`, `finality_depth`, `start_block`, `max_block_range`, `rpc`, `submitter` and `gas`. The file carries key handles and public keys only, never a private key. Its `chains` entries are EVM chains; the configuration has no Solana entry.

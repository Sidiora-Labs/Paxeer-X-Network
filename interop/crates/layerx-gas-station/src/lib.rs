//! Paxeer X Network sponsored submission library.
//!
//! Pass the JSON configuration file path to `StationConfig::load`. Fields are
//! `chain_id`, `endpoints`, `paymaster`, `token`, `decimals`, `max_rate_age`,
//! `spread_bps`, `margin_bps`, `per_account_limit`, `per_interval_limit`,
//! `per_quote_limit`, `interval_seconds`, `balance_floor`, and `relayer_key_env`. Amount limits use SID base units; the balance floor
//! uses PAX base units. The configured `relayer_key_env` names the signing
//! environment variable, conventionally `PAXEER_RELAYER_KEY`.
//!
//! The station's only price source is the paymaster's governed rate:
//! `PaymasterRateSource` reads `currentRate()` and `rateUpdatedAt()` from the
//! configured paymaster, in Sidiora base units per whole Paxeer coin. A revert,
//! a missing rate, or a rate older than `max_rate_age` refuses the quote, and the
//! quoted amount is the governed price plus `margin_bps`, within `spread_bps`.
//! The caller opens a journal path such as `state/sponsorship.jsonl` and passes
//! it to the station. Quote, admission, transaction, receipt and liability
//! transitions are keyed by sponsor and quote nonce.
//! Quotes persist reservations and signatures. Signing intents reserve nonces
//! and replacement fee ceilings before the actual signer runs; an uncertain
//! signing outcome retains that capacity and refuses further signing. Prepared entries persist the
//! transaction nonce, hash and exact signed bytes; legacy released entries are
//! refused because rejection cannot invalidate a signed transaction. A replaced entry persists the
//! fee and signed bytes of the zero-value self-transfer that fills the sponsor
//! nonce of a dropped or expired submission, written before it is broadcast; a
//! cancelled entry records that replacement's inclusion; completion records
//! contain consumed, included, reverted or cancelled outcomes. No key,
//! endpoint or credential is serialized. Entries are flushed and synced before
//! publication or broadcast. Exclusive locking prevents simultaneous writers;
//! corrupt or torn lines fail closed. Restart replays policy reservations,
//! rebroadcasts the saved bytes and resumes each replacement from the journal.
//! Active PAX liability is released only by an exact retained finalized receipt
//! or finalized chain-time expiry of a tracked quote with no signing intent.
//! A consumed quote releases only with an exact canonical finalized getter proof
//! and tracked history proving no signing attempt. Incomplete legacy histories
//! retain liability. Historical
//! account/interval usage and finalized spend remain separate. Public admission
//! is idempotent per account, batch nonce and chain interval, bounded to four
//! quotes per account, 128 per interval and 1024 active quotes.
//!
//! The `paxeer-gas-station` binary runs as
//! `paxeer-gas-station --config PATH --journal PATH`. Its configuration file
//! carries the fields above plus `listen`, the socket address it serves on
//! (port zero is refused), `gas_limit`, the gas limit of every sponsored
//! transaction, and `max_priority_fee_per_gas` in PAX base units; a quote's
//! `gasCost` must be `gas_limit` times the maximum fee per gas it pays. The
//! service answers `POST /quote` with `{quote, relayerSignature}` and
//! `POST /submit` with `{transactionHash}`, with every numeric field a decimal
//! string and `decimals` a number. A request the station refuses is answered
//! with a 4xx status; an unavailable price source, an unreachable node, an
//! unusable clock or a failing journal with a 5xx status. It speaks plain
//! HTTP: the web adapter requires an `https` endpoint, so TLS is terminated in
//! front of the process. Request bodies and read time are capped, and neither
//! a response nor a log line carries key material, a credential or a signed
//! transaction byte.
//!
//! `paxeer-gas-station rate --config PATH --journal PATH --rate-file PATH`
//! runs the rate publisher. Its configuration is the station configuration
//! without `listen` and `gas_limit`, plus `max_priority_fee_per_gas`,
//! `rate_owner_key_env` (the env variable holding the paymaster owner's key,
//! never the sponsor's), `rate_cadence_seconds` (strictly below
//! `max_rate_age`), `rate_gas_budget_per_day` (gas units per chain day) and
//! `rate_balance_floor` (PAX base units). Every cadence it reads the owner's
//! rate file (`rate`, `set_at`, optional `not_after`, integer TOML keys),
//! signs `setRate` from the owner key, journals the publication, broadcasts it
//! and journals its receipt, with its own journal file. A missing, malformed,
//! zero, not yet set or expired rate file, an exhausted daily budget or an
//! owner balance below the floor refuses the publication and logs the reason,
//! so the paymaster's rate ages until `currentRate` reverts with `StaleRate`.

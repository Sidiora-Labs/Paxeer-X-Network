# Hosted dashboard

`layerx-dashboard` is the session-authenticated developer read surface
for keys, quota, the gateway request log, webhook delivery health, and
receipt-backed test payments
(`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/main.rs`;
`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/model.rs`). The crate is
`layerx-platform-dashboard`. A companion Next.js process,
`layerx-dashboard-web`, is the browser UI on the same Ingress.

It does not accept writes. Every path except `GET /healthz` requires a
developer session. Protocol facts that the dashboard renders carry the
verification level the human plane displays; settlement is claimed only
where a verified LayerX receipt stands behind the fact
(`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/model.rs`).

Webhook registration and delivery live on
[Hosted webhooks](HostedWebhooks.md). Gateway keys and JSON-RPC live on
[Hosted gateway](HostedGateway.md) and [Public JSON-RPC](PublicRpc.md).

## Deployment

The checked-in Ingress `layerx-developer` host is
`dev.paxeer.network` (`platform/hosted/webhooks/deployment.yaml`).
Path `/v1/dashboard` goes to the dashboard API over HTTPS; path `/` goes
to the web UI. Body size on that Ingress is `512k`. On the bare-host
deployment the edge serves the web UI at `dev.paxeer.network`, the
dashboard API at `api-dev.paxeer.network` and webhooks at
`hooks.paxeer.network`.

The API listens on `LAYERX_DASHBOARD_LISTEN`, default
`0.0.0.0:9445` (`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/main.rs`). At most 256
connections are live. Inbound TLS uses
`LAYERX_DASHBOARD_TLS_CERT_DER` and `LAYERX_DASHBOARD_TLS_KEY_DER`.

---

## Authentication

`GET /healthz` is unauthenticated and returns
`{"ready": <bool>}` with HTTP 200 when ready and 503 otherwise.

Every `/v1/dashboard/*` route calls the same developer identity
introspector as webhooks: `Authorization: Bearer` or cookie
`__Host-layerx-session` (`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/main.rs`).
Failed authentication is `401 session_required`. Mutating cookie
requests are not served; the dashboard is GET-only.

---

## Routes

All listed routes are `GET`. Unknown paths and non-GET methods on
owned routes are `404 not_found`.

| Path | Result type | Fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/v1/dashboard/overview` | `Overview` | `principal`, `generated_at`, `usage`, `keys`, `requests`, `recent_requests`, `deliveries`, `endpoints`, `dead_letters`, `payments` |
| `/v1/dashboard/keys` | `KeyView[]` | per key: `key_id`, `principal`, `disabled`, `requests_per_window`, `window_seconds`, `used_in_window`, `remaining_in_window`, `window_started_at`, `window_resets_at`, `window_lapsed`, `utilisation_per_mille` |
| `/v1/dashboard/usage` | `UsageSummary` | `keys`, `live_keys`, `disabled_keys`, `requests_allowed`, `requests_used`, `requests_remaining`, `utilisation_per_mille` |
| `/v1/dashboard/requests` | `RequestRecord[]` | `at`, `operation` (optional), `operation_digest`, `outcome`, `verification` |
| `/v1/dashboard/webhooks` | endpoint health list | webhook `EndpointHealth` records |
| `/v1/dashboard/webhook-deliveries` | delivery records | optional query `endpoint=`; `limit` |
| `/v1/dashboard/webhook-dead-letters` | dead-letter records | `limit` |
| `/v1/dashboard/test-payments` | `PaymentView[]` | `event`, `subject`, `subject_sequence`, `occurred_at`, `amount`, `asset`, `verification`, `settlement_verification`, `receipt_digest`, `settled`, `facts` |
| `/v1/dashboard/receipts/{activity}` | `ReceiptView` | `activity_id`, `event`, `receipt_digest`, `verification`, `settled` |

`limit` defaults to 50 and is clamped to `1..=200`
(`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/main.rs`).
`webhook-deliveries` accepts optional `endpoint` as an `EndpointId`.

`RequestOutcome` wire words are `pending`, `completed`,
`rate-limited`, and `refused`. A request line never presents above
`unverified` because the gateway audit trail records digests rather
than receipts (`platform/hosted/dashboard/src/model.rs`).

A payment's `settled` flag is true only when the `state` fact equals
`settled`, that fact is at least `receipt-verified`, and a receipt
digest stands behind that exact fact.

## Refusals

| HTTP | Code | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | Malformed request |
| 401 | `session_required` | Missing or inactive session |
| 403 | `principal_refused` | Gateway store refused the principal |
| 404 | `receipt_not_found` | Unknown activity on `/receipts/{activity}` |
| 404 | `not_found` | Unknown path or non-GET |
| 503 | `state_unavailable` | Corrupt store, webhook or I/O failure |
| 503 | `encoding_failed` | Response JSON encoding failed |

## Source contract

- `platform/hosted/dashboard/src/main.rs` owns TLS, routing, paging, and session checks.
- `platform/hosted/dashboard/src/model.rs` owns the view models above.
- `platform/hosted/dashboard/src/service.rs` reads gateway Redis (keys, quota, audit) and the webhooks Redis reader.

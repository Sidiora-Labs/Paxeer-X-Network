# Hosted gateway

Exact public JSON-RPC requests and responses captured from the real hosted
services and a disposable native node are in
[Public payment API](PublicAPI.md).

`layerx-gateway` is the receipt-verifying public ingress for hosted
LayerX Network (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:1`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/Cargo.toml:8-10`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:885-887`). The crate is
`layerx-platform-gateway`; the binary path is `src/main.rs`. The
platform string is `tls-receipt-verifying-multi-instance-hosted-gateway`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:885-887`).

It is the only hosted surface serving public `/v1` routes to humans and SDKs.
The Human HTTPS API is a separate in-cluster Service, `layerx-human`,
selecting the node pod's `human` container on port `9447` and forwarded
on host `19453` (`platform/hosted/human/deployment.yaml:1-12`;
`platform/hosted/tests/beta-cluster.sh:1850, 1900`). Qualification binds
that Human origin as `LAYERX_QUALIFICATION_HUMAN_URL`
(`platform/hosted/tests/beta-cluster.sh:1681`). See
[Hosted Human](HostedHuman.md).

The image is `ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/layerx-gateway:0.1.0`, user
`4020:4020`, entrypoint `/usr/local/bin/layerx-gateway`
(`docker/platform-gateway/Dockerfile:5-11`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:67-69`). The Deployment has
three replicas, listens on `0.0.0.0:9443`, exposes Service port `443`
to container `9443`, and is reached as Ingress host
`api-mainnet-beta.paxeer.network`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:60`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:70-72`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:123-126`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:187-193`). PDB
`minAvailable` is `2`; HPA scales `3`–`30` on 65% CPU
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:131`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:138-143`).

The router URL `https://api-mainnet-beta.paxeer.network` is the
network's only unified endpoint: `eth_*`, `lx_*` and `px_*` methods answer
there. The block explorer is `paxscan.io` and the wallet is
`paxportwallet.com`; the sixteen public RPC names serve the EVM domain alone.

This page covers that binary, its Redis, and the tests in
`platform/hosted/gateway/`. It does not document the emulator
administration surface. `production_route` never accepts emulator
paths (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:804-808`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:880-881`).

The gateway serves public JSON-RPC at `POST /rpc`, `GET /rpc/schema`, and
`GET /rpc/ws`. The exact 18-method contract, authenticated submission rules,
result shapes, and WebSocket behavior are in [Public JSON-RPC](PublicRpc.md).

## TLS

Inbound TLS is rustls with no client authentication. The certificate
is `LAYERX_GATEWAY_TLS_CERT_DER`; the PKCS#8 key is
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_TLS_KEY_DER`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:461-480`). Each accepted TCP
connection becomes a rustls `ServerConnection`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1817-1828`). At most 256
connections are live; further accepts are shut down
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:41`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1836-1839`). Request bodies are
bounded at 8 MiB (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:40`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1825-1826`).

Outbound HTTPS uses `native_tls` `TlsConnector` with
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_OUTBOUND_CA_DER`, a PKCS#12 client identity, and a
minimum protocol of TLS 1.2
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:486-503`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:161-165`). Endpoints must be
`https://` with a DNS host, not a literal IP
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:23-26`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:46-47`). The client writes
`Authorization`, optional `Idempotency-Key`, and optional `X-Trace-Id`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:182-193`). Connect timeout is 3s;
I/O timeout is 8s (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:8-9`).

Redis is `rediss://` only, TLS 1.2, the same outbound CA, then `AUTH`
username and password (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:54-56`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:741-767`). The Redis server
manifest sets `tls-auth-clients no`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:8-12`). Those two TLS client
auth settings differ: HTTPS upstreams present a PKCS#12 identity;
Redis does not require a client certificate.

Ingress nginx uses backend protocol HTTPS, body size `512k`, connect
timeout `3`, read timeout `10`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:181-184`).

---

## Tokens

The gateway accepts two inbound schemes and four outbound Bearer
tokens. It never forwards a caller `LayerX-Key` or a caller session
Bearer as the upstream `Authorization` value.

| Credential | Accepted from | Used as | Never |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LayerX-Key {id}:{secret}` | Production `/v1` routes and `GET /internal/v1/principal` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1162-1173`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1726-1738`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1768`) | Local digest check against Redis (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:45-75`) | Sent to component, authority, identity, or registry. `Client::request` always prefixes its argument with `Bearer ` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:90-104`) |
| `Bearer` session | `/v1/keys` only (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:972-981`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1101-1108`) | JSON body `{"token": …}` to identity `POST /v1/sessions/introspect` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:982-993`) | Upstream `Authorization`. That header carries `LAYERX_GATEWAY_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` |
| Component token | File `LAYERX_GATEWAY_COMPONENT_TOKEN_FILE` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:516`) | `Authorization: Bearer` to the agent-boundary URL | Presented by humans |
| Authority token | File `LAYERX_GATEWAY_AUTHORITY_TOKEN_FILE` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:521`) | `Authorization: Bearer` to the receipt-authority URL | Presented by humans |
| Identity token | File `LAYERX_GATEWAY_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:526`) | `Authorization: Bearer` to the identity URL | Presented by humans |
| Registry token | File `LAYERX_GATEWAY_PROGRAM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_FILE` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:576`) | `Authorization: Bearer` to the program-registry URL | Presented by humans |
| Redis username and password | `LAYERX_GATEWAY_REDIS_USERNAME_FILE`, `LAYERX_GATEWAY_REDIS_PASSWORD_FILE` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:583-584`) | Redis `AUTH` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:761-767`) | HTTP |
| PKCS#12 client identity | `LAYERX_GATEWAY_CLIENT_IDENTITY_PKCS12` plus password file (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:494-502`) | Outbound HTTPS mTLS | Inbound TLS (`with_no_client_auth` at `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:479`) |

`authenticate_gateway_key` requires prefix `LayerX-Key `, an id of at
most 64 `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` characters, and a secret `lxp_live_` plus 64
hex characters (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:25-26`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:49-59`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:111-117`). The store digest is
SHA-256 over length-prefixed `gateway-key-v1`, salt, and secret
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:64`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1026-1034`). A disabled key or
digest mismatch is `AccessError::Unauthenticated`; a store error is
`AccessError::PersistenceUnavailable`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:33-36`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:60-73`). Persistence failure is
deliberately not an authentication refusal
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:28-31`).

`Bearer` on a production route is `401 api_key_required`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh:37`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/tap_nonce.rs:290-291`).

Headers `x-layerx-principal` and `x-layerx-api-key` are refused as
`400 untrusted_identity_header` before authentication
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1716-1724`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh:44`). Incoming
headers and bodies are zeroized on drop
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:215-221`). Audit events hash
principal digest, action, subject, and outcome; payloads and
credentials never enter the audit stream
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:90-92`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1090-1098`).

`Client::request_authorized` exists so another hosted ingress can
present an already validated `LayerX-Key` value to this gateway
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/http.rs:107-120`). The gateway binary
itself calls `Client::request` with the four service tokens
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:947-969`).

---

## Scopes

Issued keys carry a sorted, non-empty list of at most six scopes
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1045-1065`):

| Scope | Routes |
| --- | --- |
| `activity:write` | `POST /v1/activities` |
| `program:call` | `POST /v1/programs/call`, `/deploy`, `/upgrade`, `/wind-down` |
| `program:simulate` | `POST /v1/programs/simulate` |
| `program:read` | `GET /v1/programs/registry/{id}`, `/interface`, `/activities/{id}`, `/receipts/by-idempotency/{key}` |
| `receipt:read` | `GET /v1/receipts/{id}` |
| `state:read` | `GET /v1/state` |

`permits` is exact string match on the comma-joined record
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1072-1088`). Missing scope is
`403 insufficient_scope` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1778-1784`).

Quota is a finite fixed window: requests `1..=1_000_000`, window
`1..=2_592_000` seconds (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:164-171`).
Writes consume quota inside Redis `reserve`; reads consume it in
`consume_read` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:816-850`).

---

## Public routes

`production_route` is the production path set shared with the emulator
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:809-881`). Program identifiers in
that parser are 64 lowercase hex characters; `GET /v1/receipts/{id}`
allows any ASCII hex digit, including `A-F`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:825-828`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:874`). Those two identifier
alphabets differ.

Unauthenticated and key-management routes are dispatched before
`production_route` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1713-1759`).

| Method and path | Inputs | Upstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /livez` | none | none. Body `status=live`, `service=layerx-gateway`, `package_semver` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1741-1749`) |
| `GET /readyz` | none | Redis `PING`; component, authority `GET /readyz`; registry `GET /healthz` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1660-1711`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2799-2831`) |

| `POST /rpc` | JSON-RPC 2.0; reads are unauthenticated, submission requires `LayerX-Key` | public-core reads or the existing authenticated activity/Programs routes |
| `GET /rpc/schema` | none | embedded `openrpc.json` |
| `GET /rpc/ws` | WebSocket upgrade and `LayerX-Key`; `receipt:read` or `state:read` by topic | live authenticated receipt/account/checkpoint wakes |
| `GET /internal/v1/principal` | `LayerX-Key` | Redis key lookup. Body `principal_digest` only (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1726-1738`) |
| `POST /v1/activities` | `LayerX-Key`, `Idempotency-Key`, `application/json` `{activity}` or `application/octet-stream` signed bytes (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3088-3137`) | agent-boundary `POST /v1/activities` as `application/octet-stream` with the component token and protocol idempotency key (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3213-3226`). Then authority `GET /v1/authorized-batches/by-activity/{id}` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1176-1206`) |
| `GET /v1/state` | `LayerX-Key` and `state:read` | none. Always `503 principal_state_proof_unavailable` before quota (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1592-1593`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1631`) |
| `GET /v1/receipts/{id}` | `LayerX-Key`, `receipt:read` | Redis `activity_owner`; agent-boundary `GET /v1/receipts/{id}`; authority by-activity (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2477-2533`) |
| `POST /v1/programs/call` | `LayerX-Key`, `program:call`, `Idempotency-Key` hex32, JSON or octet-stream Programs CALL (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:305-392`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1786-1791`) | registry `GET /v1/programs/registry/{program}`; agent-boundary `POST /v1/programs/call`; authority by-activity |
| `POST /v1/programs/simulate` | same call body, `program:simulate` | registry head; agent-boundary `POST /v1/programs/simulate` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1270-1349`) |
| `POST /v1/programs/deploy` | `program:call`, octet-stream only, Programs ordinal 1 (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/program_lifecycle.rs:7-13`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3104-3121`) | agent-boundary `POST /v1/programs/deploy`; authority by-activity |
| `POST /v1/programs/upgrade` | ordinal 2, octet-stream | agent-boundary `POST /v1/programs/upgrade`; authority |
| `POST /v1/programs/wind-down` | ordinal 7, octet-stream | agent-boundary `POST /v1/programs/wind-down`; authority |
| `GET /v1/programs/registry/{id}` | `program:read`, JSON selector `program_id` plus `requested_verification_level=sequencer-signed` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:867-881`) | registry `GET /v1/programs/registry/{id}` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:395-431`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2536-2568`) |
| `GET /v1/programs/registry/{id}/interface` | same selector | registry head and `GET …/interface` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2571-2601`) |
| `GET /v1/programs/activities/{id}` | JSON selector `activity_id` plus `sequencer-signed` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:906-921`) | Redis owner and operation; pending calls agent-boundary `GET /v1/programs/activities/{id}` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2658-2708`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3588-3592`) |
| `GET /v1/programs/receipts/by-idempotency/{key}` | JSON selector `idempotency_key`, `expected_activity_id`, `sequencer-signed` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:884-903`) | Redis operation; pending lifecycle uses agent-boundary `GET /v1/programs/receipts/by-idempotency/{key}` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1480-1487`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2604-2655`) |

The component URL in the hosted manifest is the agent boundary, not
the core Service (`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:78`):

`https://layerx-agent-boundary.layerx-testnet.svc.cluster.local:9443`

Authority is
`https://layerx-receipt-authority.layerx-testnet.svc.cluster.local:9443`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:80`). Identity is
`https://layerx-identity.layerx-testnet.svc.cluster.local:9443`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:82`). Registry is
`https://layerx-program-registry.layerx-testnet.svc.cluster.local:9420`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:84`). Readiness labels the
component probe `core_agent_boundary`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2825`).
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_CORE_URL` is the separate authenticated source for
public account, proof, Asset, fee, and node-info reads. Activity submission
continues to use the agent-boundary path.

Program GET/simulate/error responses are wrapped in the agent envelope
unless the request is a successful `POST` call or lifecycle mutation
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:769-845`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1797-1805`).

Unknown `production_route` values are `404 not_found`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1760-1766`).
`GET /__emulator/reset` is 404
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh:36`).

## Config keys

| Key | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_LISTEN` | Bind address; default `0.0.0.0:9443` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:567-570`; `platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:72`) |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_TLS_CERT_DER` | Inbound server certificate DER |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_TLS_KEY_DER` | Inbound PKCS#8 key DER |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_PUBLIC_CORE_URL` | HTTPS source for public committed reads; hosted uses `layerx-pending-core` |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_OUTBOUND_CA_DER` | Trust bundle for HTTPS and Redis |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_CLIENT_IDENTITY_PKCS12` | Outbound client identity |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_CLIENT_IDENTITY_PASSWORD_FILE` | PKCS#12 password |

| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_NETWORK_ID` | Hosted network identifier; must match authority facts (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:548-553`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1191-1195`) |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_LXP_WIRE_VERSION` | Numeric wire version; must equal `STATE_COMMITMENT_PROTOCOL_VERSION` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:550-559`) |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_ID` | `u32` checked on signed activities (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:561-564`) |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_MODULE_REGISTRY_FILE` | JSON module ordinals (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2251-2291`) |
| `LAYERX_GATEWAY_IDEMPOTENCY_SECONDS` | Retention `3600..=2592000`; default `604800` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:42`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:541-546`; `platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:95`) |

The public registry admits Asset register (1), account_open (4), send (5),
receive (6), grant_issue (7), grant_revoke (8), mint (10), and burn (11), plus
Programs deploy (1), upgrade (2), call (3), transfer (5), account registration
(6), and wind-down (7). Asset pause/unpause (2/3) are excluded and ordinal 9 is
reserved. `lx_sendActivity` applies the same authenticated signer and fee path
to every admitted type. `lx_estimateFee` strictly decodes that same set and
prices canonical envelope bytes with the authenticated committed schedule;
runtime-metered schedules fail closed when the request cannot supply the
required execution or storage units.

The testnet Deployment pins `LAYERX_GATEWAY_NETWORK_ID=layerx-testnet`,
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_LXP_WIRE_VERSION=3`,
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_PROTOCOL_NETWORK_ID=402`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:91-93`).

---

## Redis state and ACL

The gateway owns StatefulSet `layerx-gateway-redis`: Redis 8.2.1,
TLS port 6379, `appendonly yes`, `appendfsync always`,
`maxmemory-policy noeviction`, `protected-mode yes`, ACL file
`/run/layerx/auth/users.acl` (`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:5-17`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:20-49`). NetworkPolicy admits
TCP 6379 only from pods `app=layerx-gateway` and allows no egress
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:147-154`).

Cluster bring-up writes ACL `user default off` and one enabled user
`layerx-gateway` with `~* &* +@all`
(`platform/hosted/tests/beta-cluster.sh:473-475`;
`platform/hosted/tests/beta-cluster.sh:497-499`). The TAP portable
test uses the same `default off` plus one enabled user shape
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/tap_nonce.rs:76-80`).

| Key | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `gateway:key:{id}` | Hash: `principal`, `salt`, `secret_digest`, `signer_public_key`, `scopes`, `quota_requests`, `quota_window_seconds`, `epoch`, `disabled` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:186`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:781-790`) |

Continuation of a signed program activity is stored in 128 KiB chunks,
at most 16 chunks / 2 MiB (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:37-39`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:1143-1184`).

## Callers the NetworkPolicy admits

`topology-check.sh` includes `platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml`
(`platform/hosted/tests/topology-check.sh:22`;
`platform/hosted/tests/topology-check.sh:86`). Gateway ingress admits
TCP 9443 from namespace `ingress-nginx` or from pods
`app=layerx-testnet-control`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:162-164`). Egress is Redis
6379, program-registry 9420, `layerx-plane: trusted-boundary` on 9443 /
9445 / 9446, and DNS 53 (`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:165-173`).

## Typed refusals

HTTP refusals use `{"ok": false, "error": {"code": …}}`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:597-605`). Library errors are
`GatewayError` and `AccessError`.

`502 receipt_verification_failed` (lifecycle) and
`503 receipt_verification_failed` (ordinary activity) are different
status codes for the same code string
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1225`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3455`).

Library `GatewayError` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:921-935`):

| Variant | Raised when |
| --- | --- |
| `Unauthenticated` | Display string only; HTTP uses `AccessError` instead (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:939-940`) |
| `Forbidden` | Submission Ed25519 verifier is not the key's signer (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:450`) |
| `InvalidRequest` | Canonical decode, protocol/network, encoding, or transfer disclosure failed (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:431-436`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:388-414`) |
| `InvalidRoute` | `production_route` miss (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:808`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:880-881`) |
| `IdempotencyConflict` | Display string; HTTP uses `409 idempotency_conflict` |
| `VerificationRequired` | Missing receipt digest or program verify failed (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:538`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:604`) |
| `UntrustedSequencer` | Authority sequencer key ≠ pinned key (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:518-524`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:585-591`) |
| `ActivityMismatch` | Receipt activity id ≠ expected (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:532-533`) |
| `Receipt(ReceiptCheck)` | `verify_outcome` failed (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:526-527`) |
| `Encoding` | JSON render failed (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:547`) |
| `Entropy` | `getrandom` failed during `IssuedKey::generate` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:209-210`) |
| `Unavailable` | Display string for a missing dependency |

`verify_submission` returns `Forbidden` for a wrong signer and
`InvalidRequest` for wire/protocol failures
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:424-456`). HTTP maps both to
`403 activity_authorization_refused`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3143-3150`).

## Receipt verification before success

A `VerifiedOperation` cannot be constructed from a status word and
bytes (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:292-294`). Public activity
JSON is rendered only from verified receipt fields
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:506-508`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:539-547`).

Ordinary activities: decode receipt hex, load `AuthorityFacts` from
authority, require the authority sequencer key to match
`LAYERX_GATEWAY_SEQUENCER_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE`, run `verify_outcome` on
the authorized batch, require the receipt activity id, then complete
Redis as `receipt_verified` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1209-1230`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:512-555`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3555-3574`). Non-zero
`result_code` on a non-program activity is stored as `refused_409`
with the verified receipt still present
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3505-3540`).

Program CALL: `verify_program_operation` checks authorized program
execution against the registry head's program id and guest ABI, plus
terminal payload and call graph
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:572-613`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1233-1267`).

Program simulation: `verify_program_simulation_operation` against the
pinned previous state root, then Ed25519 over
`LayerX/agent/program-simulation-evidence/v1` with
`committed: false` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:623-657`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2916-3021`).

Lifecycle deploy/upgrade/wind-down: `program_lifecycle::verify_receipt`
checks sequencer signature, protocol 3, module 9, module version 4,
operation 0, absent program outcome, and on `result_code == 0` a
program state proof (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/program_lifecycle.rs:69-94`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3443-3455`).

Component HTTP 202 or transport failure returns `202` with
`state: unknown` and `retained_signed_activity`; that is not a
verified success (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1403-1421`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:3227-3241`).

---

## Readiness

Gateway `GET /readyz` is ready only when Redis `PING` is `PONG`, the
agent-boundary `/readyz` is 200 JSON with `ready`, matching
`network_id` and `wire_version`, and `synchronous_receipts` plus
`state_snapshot`, the authority `/readyz` is 200 JSON with `ready` and
matching network/wire (route flags not required), and registry
`GET /healthz` is 200 JSON `status=ready`, `service=program-registry`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:1660-1711`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2799-2831`). Identity is not a
`/readyz` component. `principal_state_boundary` is always the string
`unavailable` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2828`).

Probes: Deployment `readinessProbe` HTTPS `/readyz` every 5s,
`livenessProbe` HTTPS `/livez` every 15s
(`platform/hosted/gateway/deployment.yaml:96-97`).

Testnet-control probes the gateway with unauthenticated `GET /readyz`
and requires HTTP 200 (`platform/hosted/testnet/src/main.rs:1032-1037`;
`platform/hosted/testnet/src/main.rs:1104`). Payment, receipt
inspection, and programs journeys list `Dependency::Gateway`
(`platform/hosted/testnet/src/main.rs:251-267`). Funding does not.

`GET /v1/status` reports `hosted_gateway` as `degraded` when Redis is
ready and `unavailable` when it is not; it never reports
`available` for that field (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2834-2855`).
The public status names the gateway as one of four components
`testnet`, `gateway`, `core`, `paxeer`
(`platform/hosted/testnet/src/main.rs:1647`). Those two status shapes
differ.

## Tests

Portable crate tests (no cluster):

| Test | Proves |
| --- | --- |
| `issued_key_debug_redacts_the_credential` | `IssuedKey` debug prints `[REDACTED]`, not the secret (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:962-969`) |
| `production_program_routes_are_exact_and_bounded` | Exact nine program routes; uppercase and `..` path ids are `InvalidRoute` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/lib.rs:972-1033`) |
| `continuation_tests` | 2 MiB activity hex chunks and rejects one extra byte (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/store.rs:1211-1232`) |
| `agent_program_error_envelope_is_exact` | `409 idempotency_conflict` → class `IdempotencyConflict`, `retriability=Terminal` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2057-2073`) |
| `program_error_classes_are_stable_for_provider_parity` | `quota_exceeded`→`RateLimit`; `activity_authorization_refused`→`PolicyRefusal`; `program_receipt_verification_failed`→`VerificationFailure`; `404 program_interface_absent`→`UnavailableCapability`; `LXP_ERR_*`→`CoreRejection`; 503→`TransportFailure` (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2076-2094`; `platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:631-662`) |
| `program_get_selectors_bind_every_identity_field` | Selector identity fields are exact (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/main.rs:2126-2161`) |
| `exact_native_json_and_scope_bindings` | Native JSON must match the signed payload field-for-field (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/native_call.rs:153-187`) |
| `lifecycle_signed_activity_binds_exact_route_protocol_and_payload` | Wrong signer, network, ordinal, hash, or trailing byte is refused (`platform/hosted/gateway/src/program_lifecycle.rs:150-204`) |
| `exact_pending_retry_survives_reconstruction_but_altered_nonce_reuse_is_replay` | Real Redis TAP nonce: identical retry is `AlreadyConsumed`; altered operation/path is `Replay` (`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/tap_nonce.rs:159-247`) |
| `principal_binding_comes_only_from_the_authenticated_durable_key_record` | Empty, `Bearer`, wrong secret, and revoked key are `authenticate_gateway_key` errors; principal digest is the stored record (`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/tap_nonce.rs:250-305`) |

Hosted boundary script, against a real gateway URL
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh`):

- `POST /v1/activities` with `LayerX-Key` returns `ok` and a receipt
  that `LAYERX_RECEIPT_VERIFY_BIN` accepts
  (`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh:18-34`)
- `GET /__emulator/reset` is 404 (`:36`)
- `Authorization: Bearer {secret}` on `/v1/state` is 401 (`:37`)
- Conflicting activity under the same idempotency key is 409 (`:38`)
- `GET /internal/v1/principal` is 200 with a 64-hex digest; missing
  auth is 401; `X-LayerX-Principal` is 400 (`:40-44`)

Lifecycle boundary script
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/lifecycle-boundary.sh`):

- Unauthorized POST is 401 (`:25-26`)
- JSON content type is 415 (`:27-28`)
- Missing idempotency key is 400 (`:29-30`)
- Flipped signature byte is 403 (`:31-40`)
- First submit and replay compare equal JSON results; receipt verifies
  offline (`:41-51`)

`tests/local/lifecycle.rs` runs that script against real
`layerx-gateway`, identity, receipt-authority, TLS Redis, and core
boundary processes. Unrelated signer issue is 403; exact issuance
replay is 200 with byte-identical key JSON; an unrelated TLS root
cannot complete `/livez`
(`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/local/lifecycle.rs:463-496`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/local/README.md:8-9`). The offline
verifier requires protocol 3, module 9 version 4, operation 0, success,
absent call outcome (`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/local/verifier.rs:24-34`;
`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/local/README.md:40-41`).

`tests/load.js` issues a key with a Bearer session and submits the
signed corpus to `POST /v1/activities`, requiring status 200 and a
receipt (`platform/hosted/gateway/tests/load.js:37-72`).

---

## Make targets

`platform/Makefile.inc` has no `platform-test-gateway` target. Gateway
inputs appear here:

| Target | Gateway use |
| --- | --- |
| `platform-test` | `cargo test` of the platform workspace, including `layerx-platform-gateway` (`platform/Makefile.inc:112-113`) |
| `platform-build` | workspace build (`platform/Makefile.inc:90-91`) |
| `platform-hosted-smoke` | requires `LAYERX_GATEWAY_URL` (`platform/Makefile.inc:161-173`) |
| `platform-hosted-topology-check` | `topology-check.sh`, default manifests include the gateway (`platform/Makefile.inc:177-178`; `platform/hosted/tests/topology-check.sh:22`) |
| `platform-test-agent-install` | requires `LAYERX_GATEWAY_URL` (`platform/Makefile.inc:190-201`) |

The gateway also serves `/rpc` as documented on
[Public JSON-RPC](PublicRpc.md). Commitment names for
`lx_sendActivity` are on [Commitment levels](CommitmentLevels.md).

## Version-2 module registry

`beta-cluster.sh` runs `/usr/local/bin/layerx-module-registry generate` from the
node image with networking disabled and a read-only filesystem. It
reads `ASSET_SYMBOL`, `ASSET_CURRENCY`, and `ASSET_DECIMALS` from
`platform/hosted/node/bootstrap.sh`, supplies the node network and asset id,
and passes `--custody-profile` when configured. The producer links the daemon's
actual Asset and Programs interfaces and includes Bridge only for a validated
custody profile. It refuses malformed metadata and noncanonical declarations.
The generated schema-version-2 bytes are published as `registry.json` in
`layerx-core-module-registry`, shared by gateway and receipt authority. The authority init container installs
those same canonical bytes into its private `registry.json` file.

After node readiness, `layerx-module-registry read-node` requests an authenticated
LNI preparation snapshot through the node socket as UID 4021. Bring-up compares
its module ids and ordinals with the published ConfigMap and refuses disagreement.
Assets are not compared: preparation snapshots carry no asset metadata.
The node image must install `/usr/local/bin/layerx-module-registry` for this gate.

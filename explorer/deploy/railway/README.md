# Railway service definitions

The explorer runs on Railway as services in one project: a Postgres
database, the Blockscout backend, the Next.js frontend, and optionally the
two Rust microservices under `explorer/services`. No service builds from this
repository any more: each runs the image `.github/workflows/explorer-images.yml`
publishes. The two JSON files beside this one hold the deploy configuration for
the backend and the frontend; everything else is a per-service setting or a
variable and is listed below.

## Images

Every service runs a published image. The registry path is
`ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/paxeer-x-explorer-<service>`, the path the image workflow
pushes to, and the tag comes from `EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG`:

| Service | Image |
| --- | --- |
| backend | `ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/paxeer-x-explorer-backend:${EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG}` |
| frontend | `ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/paxeer-x-explorer-frontend:${EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG}` |
| smart-contract-verifier | `ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/paxeer-x-explorer-smart-contract-verifier:${EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG}` |
| sig-provider | `ghcr.io/sidiora-labs/paxeer-x-explorer-sig-provider:${EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG}` |

The workflow publishes `sha-<short commit>` for every build on the main branch
and moves `main` and `latest` onto it, so `EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG=latest` follows
the branch and `EXPLORER_IMAGE_TAG=sha-<short commit>` pins one build. The same
variable and the same four paths drive `../docker-compose.local.yml`, where it
defaults to `latest`.

`railway.json` has no field for an image: its schema
(<https://railway.com/railway.schema.json>) describes a build and a deploy, not
a source. On Railway the image path and its tag are therefore part of the
service's source, set once per service, and the rest of the deployment stays in
the two files below.

## Per-service settings

These cannot be expressed in `railway.json` and have to be set once in the
service settings.

| Service | Source | Config file path | Public port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| backend | image, see above | `/explorer/deploy/railway/backend.railway.json` | 4000 |
| frontend | image, see above | `/explorer/deploy/railway/frontend.railway.json` | 3000 |

The config file path is resolved from the repository root.

Railway injects `PORT` into every container. Both images honour it: the
Blockscout release reads `PORT` (4000 in these definitions) and the frontend
image reads `PORT` (3000). Set the value explicitly as a service variable so
the container port and the service's target port agree.

## What each file says

`backend.railway.json` starts the published backend image with

```
/bin/sh -c "bin/blockscout eval 'Elixir.Explorer.ReleaseTasks.create_and_migrate()' && bin/blockscout start"
```

so the database is created and migrated in the same step that boots the
release. The health check is `GET /api/health/liveness`, which the API router
serves from `BlockScoutWeb.API.HealthController`. The timeout is generous
because the first deploy of a fresh database runs every migration before the
endpoint answers.

`frontend.railway.json` sets no start command on purpose: the image has an
`ENTRYPOINT` (`entrypoint.sh`) that validates the `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables,
generates the client-side env script, the favicon and the sitemap, and then runs
`node server.js`. Overriding the start command would skip that. The health check
is `GET /explorer/api/healthz`: the Next.js route in
`explorer/frontend/pages/api/healthz.tsx`, served under the `/explorer` base path
that `explorer/frontend/next.config.js` sets.

## Proving the definitions

`../tools/tests/compose-smoke-test.sh` brings the database, the recorded
JSON-RPC server under `../tools/` and the published backend image up from
`../docker-compose.local.yml` under its `fixture` profile, with no node and no
deployment involved. It waits for `GET /api/health/liveness`, then asserts that
`GET /api/v2/paxeer-x/capabilities` answers

```json
{"addr":false,"custody":false,"anchor":false,"exchange":false,"bridge":false,"launchpad":false}
```

which is the body the endpoint owes for the chain as recorded: the addr
precompile reverts `getUnifiedAccount` and the five surface precompiles carry no
code, so every surface reads as absent. The run turns the capability probe on
(`PAXEER_X_CAPABILITIES_ENABLED=true`, off by default in
`../env/backend.example.env`) and checks the fixture server's journal, so the
answer is a probe that ran against the recorded chain rather than the
never-probed default.

## Database

Use a Railway Postgres service and give the backend its connection string in
`DATABASE_URL`. The backend release has no `sslmode` default of its own, so set
`ECTO_USE_SSL` to match how the database service is reached.

## Microservices

`smart-contract-verifier` and `sig-provider` run their published images, listed
above. They listen on 8050 and take no config file, so they need no
`railway.json` — set
`SMART_CONTRACT_VERIFIER__SERVER__HTTP__ADDR` / `SIG_PROVIDER__SERVER__HTTP__ADDR`
and point the backend's `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_URL` and
`MICROSERVICE_SIG_PROVIDER_URL` at their private network addresses.

## Variable names

Names only. Every value is deployment-specific and belongs in Railway's
variable store, never in this repository. Where an example is unavoidable the
placeholder form is `<...>`.

### Backend

All of these names appear in
`explorer/backend/docker-compose/envs/common-blockscout.env`, which is the
complete upstream catalogue of backend variables.

Connection and identity — no default, the deployment must supply each one:

| Name | What it selects |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string for the indexer and the API |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Phoenix signing secret, at least 64 bytes |
| `PORT` | port the release listens on |
| `CHAIN_ID` | EIP-155 chain id of the indexed network |
| `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_HTTP_URL` | JSON-RPC HTTP endpoint of the node |
| `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_TRACE_URL` | endpoint used for tracing calls |
| `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_ETH_CALL_URL` | endpoint used for `eth_call` |
| `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_WS_URL` | websocket endpoint used for `newHeads` |
| `BLOCKSCOUT_HOST` | public host the API is served from |
| `BLOCKSCOUT_PROTOCOL` | `http` or `https` for that host |
| `API_URL` | public base URL of the API |
| `WEBAPP_URL` | public base URL of the frontend |
| `CHECK_ORIGIN` | origins accepted on the websocket |

Behaviour — these have upstream defaults, and the deployment sets them to pin
the shape of the explorer:

| Group | Names |
| --- | --- |
| transport | `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_VARIANT`, `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_TRANSPORT`, `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_DISABLE_ARCHIVE_BALANCES`, `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_FALLBACK_HTTP_URL` |
| database | `POOL_SIZE`, `POOL_SIZE_API`, `ECTO_USE_SSL`, `DATABASE_QUEUE_TARGET`, `DATABASE_READ_ONLY_API_URL` |
| chain labels | `CHAIN_TYPE`, `NETWORK`, `SUBNETWORK`, `COIN`, `COIN_NAME`, `DISABLE_MARKET` |
| API surface | `API_V2_ENABLED`, `API_V1_READ_METHODS_DISABLED`, `API_V1_WRITE_METHODS_DISABLED`, `DISABLE_WEBAPP`, `ADMIN_PANEL_ENABLED`, `API_RATE_LIMIT_DISABLED`, `RE_CAPTCHA_DISABLED`, `CHECKSUM_ADDRESS_HASHES` |
| indexer | `DISABLE_INDEXER`, `DISABLE_REALTIME_INDEXER`, `DISABLE_CATCHUP_INDEXER`, `INDEXER_CATCHUP_BLOCKS_BATCH_SIZE`, `INDEXER_CATCHUP_BLOCKS_CONCURRENCY`, `INDEXER_RECEIPTS_BATCH_SIZE`, `INDEXER_RECEIPTS_CONCURRENCY`, `INDEXER_COIN_BALANCES_BATCH_SIZE`, `INDEXER_COIN_BALANCES_CONCURRENCY`, `INDEXER_REALTIME_FETCHER_MAX_GAP`, `INDEXER_REALTIME_FETCHER_POLLING_PERIOD` |
| fetchers off | `INDEXER_DISABLE_INTERNAL_TRANSACTIONS_FETCHER`, `INDEXER_DISABLE_BLOCK_REWARD_FETCHER`, `INDEXER_DISABLE_ARCHIVAL_TOKEN_BALANCES_FETCHER`, `INDEXER_DISABLE_WITHDRAWALS_FETCHER` |
| microservices | `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_ENABLED`, `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_URL`, `MICROSERVICE_SC_VERIFIER_TYPE`, `MICROSERVICE_SIG_PROVIDER_ENABLED`, `MICROSERVICE_SIG_PROVIDER_URL`, `MICROSERVICE_VISUALIZE_SOL2UML_ENABLED`, `MICROSERVICE_VISUALIZE_SOL2UML_URL` |
| optional Redis | `API_RATE_LIMIT_HAMMER_REDIS_URL`, `ACCOUNT_REDIS_URL` |
| accounts and media | `ACCOUNT_ENABLED`, `NFT_MEDIA_HANDLER_ENABLED` |
| runtime | `DISABLE_FILE_LOGGING`, `HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT`, `TXS_STATS_DAYS_TO_COMPILE_AT_INIT`, `COIN_BALANCE_HISTORY_DAYS` |

Without `API_RATE_LIMIT_HAMMER_REDIS_URL` the rate limiter falls back to an
in-process ETS table, which is correct for a single replica and wrong for
several; add Redis before scaling the backend out.

### Frontend

These names appear in
`explorer/backend/docker-compose/envs/common-frontend.env`:

| Name | What it selects |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_HOST` | host the browser calls for the API |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PROTOCOL` | `http` or `https` for that host |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_PATH` | path prefix the API is mounted under |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_WEBSOCKET_PROTOCOL` | `ws` or `wss` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_HOST` | host the frontend itself is served from |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PROTOCOL` | `http` or `https` for that host |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_NAME` | full network name in the interface |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_SHORT_NAME` | short name used where space is tight |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID` | EIP-155 chain id, same value as `CHAIN_ID` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_CURRENCY_NAME` | native coin name |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_CURRENCY_SYMBOL` | native coin ticker |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_CURRENCY_DECIMALS` | decimals the interface formats with |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOMEPAGE_CHARTS` | charts shown on the home page |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTNET` | marks the interface as a test network |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SPEC_URL` | OpenAPI document linked from the API page |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STATS_API_HOST` | stats microservice, only if one is deployed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_VISUALIZE_API_HOST` | visualizer microservice, only if deployed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` | required for wallet interaction |

Four more names are not in that file but are needed whenever the API and the
frontend are not behind one proxy on the default port. They are part of the
frontend's own catalogue, `explorer/frontend/docs/ENVS.md`:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_PORT`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_BANNER_PROVIDER`,
`NEXT_PUBLIC_AD_TEXT_PROVIDER`.

The frontend image validates this set on start against
`explorer/frontend/deploy/tools/envs-validator`. A name the schema does not know, or a required
name left empty, stops the container rather than being ignored, so a typo in
the Railway variable store surfaces as a failed deploy and not as a subtly
wrong page.

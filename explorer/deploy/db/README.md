# Explorer database at 500k+ blocks per day

Operational notes for the Paxeer X Network explorer's PostgreSQL 16 instance: what the new
migrations change, why range partitioning of `logs` and `token_transfers` cannot be delivered
without application changes, and how the read-only API endpoint is wired.

## 1. The hot tables as they actually are

| table | primary key | foreign keys | access path on block number |
|---|---|---|---|
| `blocks` | `(hash)` | — | `blocks_number_index`; `one_consensus_block_at_height` unique on `number` where `consensus` |
| `transactions` | `(hash)` | `block_hash → blocks(hash)` cascade | `transactions_block_number_index`, `transactions_recent_collated_index (block_number DESC, index DESC)`, four `(address, block_number, index, inserted_at, hash)` composites |
| `logs` | `(transaction_hash, block_hash, index)` | `block_hash → blocks(hash)`, `transaction_hash → transactions(hash)` cascade | `logs_block_number_ASC__index_ASC_index`, `logs_block_number_DESC__index_DESC_index` |
| `token_transfers` | `(transaction_hash, block_hash, log_index)` | `block_hash → blocks(hash)`, `transaction_hash → transactions(hash)` cascade | `token_transfers_block_number_index` plus ASC/DESC `(block_number, log_index)` pairs |
| `internal_transactions` | `(block_hash, block_index)` | `block_hash → blocks(hash)`, `transaction_hash → transactions(hash)` cascade | **none** — the ordering index was dropped upstream and the three surviving `block_number DESC` indexes are all partial and lead with an address column |
| `address_coin_balances` | `(address_hash, block_number)` | — | `address_coin_balances_block_number_index` |

Nothing references `logs`, `token_transfers` or `internal_transactions` by foreign key.
`block_number` is `NOT NULL` only on `address_coin_balances`; on `transactions`, `logs`,
`token_transfers` and `internal_transactions` it is nullable `integer`.

## 2. Storage migrations

Three migrations under `backend/apps/explorer/priv/repo/migrations/`, all idempotent and all with a real `down`. None of them takes a lock
stronger than `SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE`, so they can run against a live indexer.

### `..._hot_tables_storage_parameters`

`ALTER TABLE ... SET (...)` on the six tables above, plus the TOAST relations of
`transactions`, `logs` and `internal_transactions`.

* **`fillfactor`** — at the default of 100 a page has no free space, so every update writes
  the new row version to a different page and therefore has to add an entry to *every* index
  on that row. Below 100 the update can stay on its page and be HOT, and the index trees stop
  bloating. `transactions` gets 85 and `address_coin_balances` 80 because both are updated
  after insertion — transactions get their block assignment and receipt fields, coin balances
  get `value` and `value_fetched_at`. The append-mostly tables get 90.
* **`autovacuum_*_scale_factor = 0.0` with absolute thresholds** — the defaults are
  proportional: 20% dead tuples to vacuum, 10% to analyze. On a table holding a billion rows
  that is 200 million dead tuples, so autovacuum and, worse, autoanalyze never fire; the
  planner's block-number statistics go stale by days and range queries start choosing the
  wrong index. Absolute thresholds trigger on a fixed amount of churn whatever the table size.
* **`autovacuum_vacuum_insert_*`** — append-only tables produce no dead tuples, so the
  dead-tuple trigger alone never marks pages all-visible. Without that, index-only scans fall
  back to heap fetches and the anti-wraparound vacuum arrives as one enormous stall instead of
  a stream of small ones. The insert-based trigger (PostgreSQL 13+) keeps the visibility map
  current.
* **`autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`** — the default budget of 200 amounts to a few MB/s of
  vacuum throughput, far below this write rate; a pass over the largest tables would never
  finish.
* **`vacuum_truncate = false`** — truncating trailing empty pages needs a brief
  `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the table. On append-only tables there is nothing to reclaim, so
  the only effect is a periodic lock spike against both the indexer and the API.

### `..._internal_transactions_block_number_brin_index`

`internal_transactions` is the one hot table with no access path on `block_number` alone.
Block-range work — reorg cleanup, the internal-transaction delete queue, re-fetching traces
for a range — therefore sequentially scans one of the largest tables in the database.

BRIN is the right shape here rather than a btree. Rows arrive in block order, so the physical
correlation is close to 1 and a summary of a few hundred kilobytes covers a table of hundreds
of gigabytes. More to the point at this write rate, BRIN costs almost nothing on insert,
whereas a btree on `block_number` would add a page write to every trace inserted.
`pages_per_range = 128` trades some scan precision for a smaller index; `autosummarize = on`
summarizes new ranges without waiting for a manual `brin_summarize_new_values`.

The index is built `CONCURRENTLY` outside a migration transaction, so the migration never
blocks writers. If the build is interrupted PostgreSQL leaves an invalid index behind; drop it
by name and re-run.

No BRIN index is added on `logs`, `token_transfers`, `transactions` or `blocks` — each already
has a btree covering the block number, and a second overlapping access path would buy nothing
and cost write amplification on the tables that can least afford it.

### `..._hot_tables_block_number_statistics`

`ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS 1000` on the six block-number columns and on
`blocks.timestamp`. Block number only ever increases, so with the default 100 histogram
buckets the newest bucket spans days of chain history and the planner badly misjudges the
selectivity of "the last N blocks" — the single most common shape of query the explorer runs.
A larger histogram costs a slower `ANALYZE` and nothing else.

### Rolling back

```
mix ecto.rollback -r Explorer.Repo -n 3
```

`down` resets the storage parameters to the cluster defaults, drops the BRIN index
concurrently, and returns the statistics targets to `-1` (meaning
`default_statistics_target`): after
the rollback `pg_class.reloptions` is null on all six tables, the BRIN index is gone and every
touched column is back to `-1`.

### Applying to a live database

Use a short `lock_timeout` so a migration can never queue behind a long-running read:

```
PGOPTIONS='-c lock_timeout=5s' mix ecto.migrate
```

The BRIN migration sets `@disable_ddl_transaction` and `@disable_migration_lock`, so it must
not be run at the same time as another migrator against the same database.

## 3. Range partitioning of `logs` and `token_transfers`: blocked

Moving either table to `PARTITION BY RANGE (block_number)` is not possible without changing
application code: the ORM and the existing unique constraints do not allow it. The blockers are
structural.

**A. The primary keys do not contain the partition key.** PostgreSQL requires every unique
constraint on a partitioned table to include all partition key columns, so PostgreSQL refuses
it against this schema:

```
CREATE TABLE logs_partitioned (LIKE logs INCLUDING ALL) PARTITION BY RANGE (block_number);
ERROR:  unique constraint on partitioned table must include all partitioning columns
DETAIL:  PRIMARY KEY constraint on table "logs_partitioned" lacks column "block_number"
         which is part of the partition key.
```

`token_transfers` fails identically. So `block_number` has to join both primary keys.

**B. The bulk importers pin the conflict target in code.**
`Explorer.Chain.Import.Runner.Logs` passes
`conflict_target: [:transaction_hash, :index, :block_hash]` and
`Explorer.Chain.Import.Runner.TokenTransfers` passes
`[:transaction_hash, :log_index, :block_hash]`. PostgreSQL matches `ON CONFLICT (cols)` to a
unique index on exactly those columns, and after (A) no such index can exist. Against a
partitioned table whose key is widened as (A) demands, PostgreSQL answers:

```
INSERT INTO logs_part VALUES (...) ON CONFLICT (transaction_hash, index, block_hash) DO NOTHING;
ERROR:  there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
```

Every import batch would fail. Both runners also carry a second, different conflict target for
the `optimism`/`celo` chain identity, so there are four call sites to change, not two — and
changing them is an application change.

**C. The Ecto schemas declare the composite key.** `Explorer.Chain.Log` and
`Explorer.Chain.TokenTransfer` mark `index`/`log_index`, `block_hash` and `transaction_hash`
as `primary_key: true` under `@primary_key false`. That key drives `Repo.get`, changeset
uniqueness, association loading and the `returning: true` round-trip the importers depend on.
Widening the database key without widening the schema leaves the two disagreeing; widening the
schema changes the public shape of those structs and is, again, application code.

**D. The partition key is nullable today.** `logs.block_number` and
`token_transfers.block_number` both allow NULL. Putting the column in the primary key makes it
`NOT NULL` implicitly, which needs a validated backfill over the existing rows and a guarantee
that no importer path ever writes NULL. Without that, rows are simply rejected:

```
ERROR:  no partition of relation "logs_part" found for row
DETAIL:  Partition key of the failing row contains (block_number) = (null).
```

The alternative — a permanent `DEFAULT` partition — silently collects those rows and defeats
partition pruning for every query that does not constrain `block_number`.

**E. Nothing creates partitions.** `mix ecto.migrate` runs once per deployment; partitions have
to keep appearing ahead of the chain head forever. At 500k blocks per day a 10-million-block
partition is used up in under three weeks. That needs a scheduled maintenance job (pg_partman
or an application-side task), which this deployment does not have and which is code as well.

Only the storage migrations of section 2 are in the tree. Partitioning remains a deliberate
fork-level change to `apps/explorer/lib/explorer/chain/{log,token_transfer}.ex` and
`apps/explorer/lib/explorer/chain/import/runner/{logs,token_transfers}.ex`, with its own
migration of the existing data. It should not be slipped in under a storage-tuning change.

### The order to use if that work is taken on

Add `block_number NOT NULL` to both tables behind a `NOT VALID` check validated in the
background; change the two schemas and the four runner call sites to a key and conflict target
that include `block_number`; create the partitioned table under a new name with the widened
key; attach the existing table as the first partition after adding a check constraint matching
its bounds, so the attach can skip validation; swap the names in one short transaction; then
run a maintenance job that keeps creating the next partition. Every step before the swap is
reversible; the swap is not. Note that the two foreign keys on each table point *out* at
`blocks` and `transactions`, which a partitioned table may keep, and that nothing points back
at either table — so the foreign keys are not an obstacle, only the keys and the code are.

## 4. Read-only API endpoint

`DATABASE_READ_ONLY_API_URL` is wired end to end and needed no change. The path is:

* `Explorer.Repo.ConfigHelper.get_api_db_url/0` returns it, falling back to `DATABASE_URL`.
* `config/runtime/prod.exs` feeds that into `Explorer.Repo.Replica1` together with
  `POOL_SIZE_API`; `config/runtime/dev.exs` does the same and drops the primary pool default
  from 40 to 30 when the variable is present.
* `Explorer.Repo.Replica1` is declared `read_only: true`, so Ecto generates no write callbacks
  on it, and it is absent from `ConfigHelper.repos/0`, so migrations never target it.
* `Explorer.Chain.select_repo/1` returns `Explorer.Repo.replica/0` for `api?: true`, and the
  `Repo.replica()` call sites in the Etherscan-compatible and API v2 read paths resolve to the
  same module.
* `Explorer.Utility.ReplicaAccessibilityManager` starts only when the variable is set. Every
  ten seconds it reads `pg_is_in_recovery()` and the replay lag; if the lag exceeds
  `REPLICA_MAX_LAG` (`config/runtime.exs`, default five minutes) it sets
  `:replica_inaccessible?`, which makes `Explorer.Repo.replica/0` fall back to the primary
  until the replica catches up.

Size `POOL_SIZE_API` against the replica's own `max_connections` rather than the primary's —
the two pools are independent.

## 5. Seeding a fresh database from an older one

`../tools/copy-blockscout-11-to-10.sh` copies the chain tables of a Blockscout 11.x database
into a freshly migrated 10.2.6 one. It reads both connection strings from `SRC_DATABASE_URL`
and `DST_DATABASE_URL` and from nowhere else, and it prints neither.

### The two cuts

Before the first table is read the run pins two cuts, and every table is copied and counted
under one of them.

The first is a **block ceiling**: the highest block number the source has marked `consensus`
at that moment. Every table that carries a block number is bounded by it on both sides of the
comparison.

The second is an **insert cut**: the source's own clock, read in UTC at the same moment. It
bounds the tables that carry no block number at all — `addresses`, `tokens`,
`contract_methods` — through the `inserted_at` column Blockscout stamps on every row and the
copy carries across unchanged. Both sides are compared as epoch seconds, so neither session's
`TimeZone` can shift the comparison. Without the insert cut, a source that keeps writing
addresses while the copy runs would be counted as rows the copy had lost.

So a source that keeps indexing cannot be read as a missing row: what it grows by is above the
cut on both sides of the comparison. Both cuts are printed at the start of the run and
repeated in the summary. A table with neither a block number nor an `inserted_at` on both
sides has no cut to apply; it is copied whole and counted whole, and the summary names it.

A row whose block number is null — a pending transaction, a log the indexer has not yet
assigned — is below no ceiling and is not copied. The same predicate excludes it from both
counts, so it is not a mismatch either. Re-indexing writes those rows in the destination.

### Resuming

A table that carries a block number on both sides is copied in block-aligned batches;
`BLOCK_BATCH` sets how many block numbers one batch spans and defaults to 100000. A batch is
one statement, so it is either wholly inserted or not inserted at all and no block is ever
half copied. That statement also advances the table's row in
`public.paxeer_x_copy_progress` in the destination, which the tool creates:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `table_name` | the table the row is about |
| `ceiling` | the ceiling the last run used |
| `highest_key` | the highest block number the tool has copied, including ranges that held no row |
| `rows_copied` | rows inserted across every run |
| `updated_at` | when that last changed |

A later run continues each table above the greater of that record and the table's own highest
copied block, and inserts with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, so a row that is already there keeps
the values it has and a rerun with nothing to do writes nothing. An interrupted copy is
resumed by running the same command again.

Tables with no block number on both sides — `addresses`, `tokens`, `contract_methods` and the
rest — have no key to resume from. They are copied whole up to the insert cut under the same
conflict handling, so a rerun still writes nothing.

Rows land in an unlogged staging table (`public.paxeer_x_copy_stage`) first, because `COPY`
itself has no conflict handling; the tool drops it when the table is done. Both it and the
progress table can be dropped once the seeding is finished.

### Repairing

Continuing above the highest key already copied is an optimisation, and on its own it would be
unsound. A source row can appear below that mark after the fact — a block range the source was
still backfilling, or a row that had no block number when the copy passed it and was given one
under the ceiling afterwards — and a run that only ever moves forward would never see it.

The verification is what decides. When a table comes up short under its cut, the run rescans
that table's whole range under the cut, which `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes free for every
row already in the destination, and counts it again. The summary names every table it rescanned
and how many rows the rescan added. A table that is still short afterwards, or that holds more
rows than the source does under the cut, is reported and the run ends `3`: this tool never
deletes a row to make a count agree.

### The destination guard

A destination table that holds rows the tool has no progress record for is refused, and the
run stops naming that table; `ALLOW_NONEMPTY_DESTINATION=1` appends to it anyway. Resuming the
tool's own interrupted run needs no flag — those rows are recorded — so the guard still only
stands between the copy and data that came from somewhere else.

### Columns

The two schemas are intersected by column name at run time rather than mapped in advance. A
source column the destination has no name for is reported as it is skipped, and the summary
repeats them by name for `transactions` and `internal_transactions`. A destination column the
source cannot answer for is left at its default.

`internal_transactions.trace_address` is the exception. The 10.2.6 schema creates it `NOT
NULL` while an 11.x row may carry no trace address at all, so copying the value across as it
stands puts a null into a column that forbids it and the table fails as a whole. The copy
derives it instead from the source's own representation of where the row sits: the root call
of a transaction, at index 0, gets the empty array Blockscout writes for it, and every other
row gets its index as a one-element array. The source carries no parent link, so the derived
value is the row's flat position within its transaction rather than a reconstruction of the
call tree; it is unique per transaction and orders the rows the way the source orders them. A
source row that does carry a trace address keeps the one it has.

### Verifying

After the last table the tool counts both sides under each table's cut and prints one line per
table, rescans any table that came up short and counts it again, and then prints the summary.
It exits `0` when every table matches, `1` on a usage or precondition failure, `2` when a copy
was refused or failed — naming the table it stopped on — and `3` when the copy finished but at
least one table's counts still differ, naming every such table with both counts.

`DRY_RUN=1` pins and prints both cuts, plans each table and reports the column differences
without writing anything at all, including the progress table.

### Proving it

`../tools/tests/copy-blockscout-test.sh` starts two disposable PostgreSQL 16 containers on
ephemeral loopback ports, creates a source schema shaped like 11.x and a destination schema
shaped like 10.2.6, seeds synthetic rows, and asserts the tool's exit code and the resulting
row counts across a dry run, a full copy, a rerun, a copy interrupted part way through a
table, its resume, a source that grows in both a block table and a block-less one after the
cuts are pinned, the non-empty destination guard, a source row that appears under the ceiling
after the copy has passed it, and a destination holding a row the source does not. It removes
both containers on every exit path and needs `docker` and `psql` on the path.

defmodule Explorer.Chain.PaxeerX.Capabilities do
  @moduledoc """
  Discovery of the Paxeer X Network surfaces the connected node answers today.

  The LayerX-side precompiles are not part of the chain that is live now: they
  arrive with a later upgrade, and until then `eth_getCode` at their addresses
  answers `0x`. Everything the explorer builds on top of them has to ask before
  it renders, so this process probes the node the same way the platform gateway
  does and publishes the answer to the rest of the application.

  One probe reads the node head with `eth_blockNumber` and then, at that one
  height, issues

    * `eth_getCode` for the custody (`0x…1013`), anchor (`0x…1014`), exchange
      (`0x…1015`), bridge (`0x…1016`) and launchpad (`0x…1017`) precompiles — a
      surface is live when the answer carries at least one byte of code;
    * one `eth_call` of `getUnifiedAccount(address)` (selector `0x357feed6`) at
      the addr precompile `0x…1004`, which exists before the upgrade but only
      answers that method after it — the capability is live when the call
      returns the declared four-word head instead of reverting.

  The first probe runs from the process's own message loop, scheduled by
  `init/1` for immediately, and every following one after
  `PAXEER_X_CAPABILITIES_REFRESH_SECONDS` (30 by default). No remote call is
  made from `init/1` itself: the process reports started before it speaks to the
  node, so a node that is unreachable, slow or throttled delays this probe alone
  and never the supervisor that has the rest of the application behind it. Until
  the first probe succeeds the published snapshot is the all-absent one, which
  is what the chain answers before the upgrade anyway. A probe that the node
  refuses leaves the previous answer in place and is retried on the next tick;
  it never replaces a known answer with a guess.

  ## API for other modules

  These four functions are the stable surface other parts of the explorer call:

    * `live?/1` — `true` when the capability was live at the last successful
      probe, `false` for every capability while the process is not running or
      has not answered yet. Takes `:custody`, `:anchor`, `:exchange`, `:bridge`,
      `:launchpad` or `:unified_account`.
    * `all/0` — the whole snapshot as a map of those six booleans plus
      `:checked_at`, the `DateTime` of the last successful probe or `nil`.
    * `refresh/0` — probes now, in the caller's stead, and returns the snapshot
      it stored; `{:error, reason}` when the node refuses.
    * `surfaces/0` — the capability names in their published order.

  A caller never has to check whether the process is running: a missing process
  reads as "nothing is live", which is what the chain answers today.

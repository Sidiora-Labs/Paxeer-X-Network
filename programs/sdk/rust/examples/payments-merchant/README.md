# Program-funded merchant split

This ABI-v2 guest stages one principal-funded deposit followed by two program
account payouts. The kernel must commit all three 402 legs atomically. A refusal
in either payout must abort the deposit too. Native activity, receipt and terminal
fixtures for a deployment, the account registration and three calls are committed
under `programs/fixtures/pay5/native-merchant`, beside the built
`programs/fixtures/pay5/payments-merchant.wasm`.

Before invoking, the deployment registration authority submits the payload from
`PreparedProgramAccount::registration_payload()` for seed `payments-merchant`
and the chosen registered asset. Wait for its verified receipt and asset-bound
account state. Derivation alone does not register or fund an account.

The caller authorizes a Transfer402 grant to the derived account for `gross`,
and ProgramSpend grants from that account to the merchant for `gross - fee`
and the fee collector for `fee`. Use `ProgramPaymentCapabilities` with one `PaymentGrant::Basic` funding grant
and two `PaymentGrant::ProgramSpend` payouts. The SDK sorts the mixed set in
runtime authority-key order and refuses duplicate keys, zero ceilings and
short output buffers. Concatenating individual set encodings is invalid. The destinations and split
are caller-approved inputs, not an authenticated merchant pricing policy.

Calldata, all integers big-endian:

`version:u16=1 || asset:32 || merchant_account:32 || collector_account:32 || gross:u128 || fee:u128`

The guest refuses nested calls, malformed input, reserved identifiers, zero legs,
fee greater than or equal to gross, missing capabilities, and exhausted ceilings.
The host must also refuse missing registration, wrong asset bindings, insufficient
funds and invalid receipts. One seed binds one asset; deploy a separate instance
for another asset.

Build from the example directory so `programs/.cargo/config.toml` (vendored
sources and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` code-generation flags) applies:

```
cd programs/sdk/rust/examples/payments-merchant
cargo build --locked --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

usage: tools/bringup/check-live.sh hosts

Checks one system of the Paxeer X Network bring-up against its live answers.
Every subcommand reads the operator's private host map from the file named
by BRINGUP_HOSTS_FILE and never prints a value from it.

hosts     runs ssh true against every destination of every role of the host
          map and prints one line per role:
  <ROLE>  "pass <ROLE> reachable=<n>/<m>" when all m destinations answered,
          "fail <ROLE> reachable=<n>/<m> ssh=<exit>" otherwise, with the exit
          code of the first destination that did not answer (255 when ssh
          could not connect, 124 when CHECK_LIVE_TIMEOUT elapsed)
          Exits 0 only when every role passes.

Environment:
  BRINGUP_HOSTS_FILE   private env file assigning EDGE_HOST, KERNEL_HOST,
                       PLATFORM_HOST, EXPLORER_HOST, ARCHIVE_HOST,
                       VALIDATOR_HOSTS, RPC_HOSTS and HPX_HOST; each value is
                       one ssh destination or, for the plural roles, a
                       space-separated list of them
  CHECK_LIVE_TIMEOUT   seconds per request, default 30

Exits 1 when any check fails, 2 on a usage error, an unset BRINGUP_HOSTS_FILE
or a host map lacking a role.

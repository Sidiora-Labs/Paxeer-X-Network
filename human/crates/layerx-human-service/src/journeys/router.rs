//! One stated intent, one deterministic cross-domain plan, one signature set.
//!
//! A human states an intent once: move an amount of one asset from a source
//! endpoint to a destination endpoint, where either end may be the bound Paxeer
//! wallet or a `LayerX` account, agent or agent budget. [`plan`] turns that intent
//! plus one observed state snapshot into a single ordered plan spanning both
//! domains. Planning is pure: it reads no clock, no randomness and performs no
//! input/output, so the same intent over the same observed state always yields
//! byte-identical canonical plan bytes and therefore the same plan digest.
//!
//! # Canonical tie-breaking
//!
//! Every feasible candidate is ordered by, in strict priority:
//!
//! 1. fewest legs,
//! 2. lowest total fee,
//! 3. lexicographic order of the candidate's mechanism-label sequence,
//! 4. lexicographic order of the candidate's canonical plan bytes.
//!
//! Rules 1 to 3 are the documented routing rule. Rule 4 is the residual
//! tie-break that makes selection total, and it is the only rule an advisor may
//! displace: see [`RouteAdvisor`].
//!
//! # Top-ups
//!
//! A top-up leg — moving funds from the Paxeer side into `LayerX`, or funding an
//! agent budget, so that a payment becomes possible — is emitted only when the
//! observed state contains a user-signed allowance whose scope and remaining
//! caps cover that exact leg. Each top-up leg records the allowance it consumes.
//! Where no allowance covers the shortfall the plan is refused with
//! [`Refusal::TopUpNotAuthorized`]. No allowance is ever widened or synthesised.
//!
//! # Digest binding
//!
//! The plan digest commits to the intent and to every leg. Each leg's agent
//! action key and signing context are derived from that digest, so a signed plan
//! cannot be re-routed: altering any leg changes the digest, which changes every
//! action key and the engine idempotency key.

//! One truthful observed state for the unified intent router.
//!
//! [`plan`](super::plan) is pure: it consumes an [`ObservedState`] and never
//! reads the network itself. This module is the only place that assembles that
//! snapshot, and it holds one rule above all others: **a state that is not
//! fully known is never planned on**. Every source that cannot answer produces
//! a typed [`ObservationError`] naming the source, and no absent reading is
//! ever substituted with a zero, an empty table or a default.
//!
//! The snapshot has three kinds of source, each read from the one place that
//! is authoritative for it:
//!
//! * **The bound wallet and its Paxeer balances** come from the Paxeer X
//!   Network gateway's `px_*` joins, through the shared
//!   [`layerx_network_gateway`] client. The gateway is the only party that sees
//!   both domains, and its answers stay tagged as gateway-reported.
//! * **The LayerX-side spendable balances, the allowance inventory and the
//!   budget bindings** come from the service's own authoritative records — the
//!   agent runtime's balance and budget reads and the journeys resolver's
//!   route inputs. They are never taken from the caller's request: a request
//!   states an intent, never the headroom that would authorise it.
//! * **The fee schedule and limits** come from the same component configuration
//!   that move, deposit and withdraw already take them from.
//!
//! [`ObservedStateBuilder`] refuses to build until every one of those sources
//! has answered, so a partially observed state cannot reach the planner.

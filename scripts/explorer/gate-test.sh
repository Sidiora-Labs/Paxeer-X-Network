#
# The explorer test gate, the path the workflow contract names as the test
# gate. It runs the backend Paxeer X suites through
# explorer/deploy/tools/mix-in-builder.sh, one invocation per umbrella
# application so that each of them gets a database sidecar and a virtual
# machine of its own, and then the frontend type check and the frontend vitest
# suite from explorer/frontend. Run it from anywhere:
#

#   scripts/explorer/gate-test.sh --check
#
# Each leg is bounded by EXPLORER_GATE_BUDGET_SECONDS, 1500 by default, applied
# through timeout(1). The gate stops on the first leg that fails or exhausts
# its budget and reports that leg, the command it ran, its exit code and its
# log path instead of starting the next one, so a landing decision is never
# open-ended.
#
# Exit codes: 0 when every leg passes; the exit code of the first failing leg;
# 124 when a leg exhausts its budget; 1 when the toolchain does not resolve.

Usage: scripts/explorer/gate-test.sh [--check]

Runs the explorer test gate: the backend Paxeer X suites through the pinned
Elixir builder with a database sidecar of its own, then the frontend type check
and the frontend vitest suite.

  --check     validate this script, the container runtime, the builder image
              recipe, the node toolchain and the three lint scripts, then exit
              without running a suite
  -h, --help  print this usage

Environment

  EXPLORER_GATE_BUDGET_SECONDS  seconds allowed per leg, 1500 by default; a leg
                                that exhausts it stops the gate with exit code
                                124 instead of starting the next leg
  EXPLORER_GATE_LOG_DIR         directory the leg logs are written to; the
                                default is build/explorer-gates under the
                                repository root

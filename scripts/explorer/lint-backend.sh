#
# The explorer backend lint gate: formatting and static analysis over the
# Elixir umbrella under explorer/backend. Both checks run through
# explorer/deploy/tools/mix-in-builder.sh, so the continuous-integration job
# and a developer run the same mix invocations against the same pinned
# toolchain.
#
# Run from anywhere:
#
#   scripts/explorer/lint-backend.sh
#
# Every check runs even when an earlier one fails, so one invocation reports
# every finding; the exit code is the first non-zero one, and the failing
# command and its log path are printed at the end.
#
# Exit codes: 0 when both checks pass; the first non-zero mix exit code
# otherwise; 1 when the runner or the log directory does not resolve.

# Offline check of .github/workflows/xweb-test.yml: the workflow triggers on
# pull requests and pushes to main; it carries one concurrency group per ref with
# cancel-in-progress; its path filters are exactly the trees the paxeer-x-web
# feature touches and the trees its legs exercise, each naming a path this
# repository holds or a path a task of spec/paxeer-x-web/spec.kvx adds; its five jobs are the five legs, each named
# for the tools it runs, and together they run exactly the commands of the
# feature's gate task verify_cmd, each from the repository root with a tool the
# same job installs first at a version this repository already pins; every
# action is pinned by commit to a pin another workflow in this repository uses;
# and no continue-on-error or conditional step is present. The check then
# mutates the workflow and requires each mutation to be refused, so the
# assertions are known to bite. No network and no runner are involved.

usage: scripts/ci/release-artifact-record.sh <name> <file> <digest_of> <signature> <sbom> <attestation> <location>

Appends one [artifact.<n>] section to artifacts.kvx in the current directory,
recording the retained artifact <file> (a path relative to the current
directory) of the declared package <name> at LAYERX_RELEASE_VERSION with the
sha256 of its bytes. <digest_of> states what the digest hashes: built-bytes
(the bytes the job built and uploaded), registry-bytes (the bytes the registry
serves, fetched after publication) or source-archive (the archive of the
published source tree). <signature>, <sbom> and <attestation> are retained
files relative to the current directory or external references of the form
<scheme>:<locator>; <location> is the registry URL the published bytes are
fetched from (https://..., simple+https://.../<project>/ or
git+https://<repository>#<tag>), empty only while the artifact is unpublished.
The release tool reads the record when it emits the artifact manifest.

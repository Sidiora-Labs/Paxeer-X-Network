# We have to build regen-network protoc-gen-gocosmos from source because
# the module uses replace directive, which makes it impossible to use
# go install like a healthy human being.
#
# As a workaround, we download the source code to a temporary location
# and build the binary. buf.gen.yaml then implicitly uses the path to the
# built binary. This is ugly but it works, and results in the least amount
# of changes across the repo to have _a_ working solution without accidentally
# breaking anything else or introduce too much change as part of automating
# the proto generation.

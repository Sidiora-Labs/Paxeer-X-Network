# Reference applications

Node.js reference applications for the LayerX domain of Paxeer X Network.

The four applications in `reference-apps.json` are complete Node.js projects selected by a checked-in environment profile. Clone this repository, install the locked workspace once with `npm ci`, compile every workspace in dependency order with `npm run build`, then use one declared command.

Asset encodings, public RPC, and 402 commitment extras are documented on
[`docs/wiki/PaymentsQuickstart.md`](../../docs/wiki/PaymentsQuickstart.md)
and [`docs/wiki/CommitmentLevels.md`](../../docs/wiki/CommitmentLevels.md).

| Application | Emulator | Beta |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer agent | `npm run start:emulator --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-buyer-agent` | `npm run start:beta --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-buyer-agent` |
| Paid API | `npm run start:emulator --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-paid-api` | `npm run start:beta --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-paid-api` |
| Merchant shop | `npm run start:emulator --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-merchant-shop` | `npm run start:beta --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-merchant-shop` |
| Programs marketplace | `npm run start:emulator --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-marketplace` | `npm run start:beta --workspace @sidiora/layerx-example-marketplace` |

Each `layerx.example.json` contains public endpoints, network names, and the names of environment variables that supply account-specific values. Tokens and signing material are never stored in these files and every application runs on Node.js, not in a browser. The buyer, seller, and merchant applications resolve batch authority from the selected environment and independently verify canonical receipts. Pending, Unknown, and Refused remain distinct responses.

`merchant-checkout` remains a workspace compatibility name for consumers created before the canonical `merchant-shop` name. It launches the same receipt-backed service and has its own declared profile.

The marketplace is a real no-std LayerX Program. Its shared listing state, receipt-read grant, receipt replay record, bounded transfer, deletion, and events execute in the Programs runtime. Its launch command builds deterministic WASM with the LayerX CLI, deploys it directly to the endpoint selected by the checked-in profile, resolves the returned receipt, and verifies it before reporting completion. List and buy commands are also declared in its package.

`make platform-test-reference-apps` (from the repository root) runs `node platform/examples/run-reference-apps.mjs --check`, which checks the four project declarations against their packages and profiles. The build-and-check flow described below executes the four applications against real receipts.

## Running the whole journey

`node platform/examples/run-reference-apps.mjs --scenario emulator` is self-contained on any host that has the `layerx` CLI built. It resolves the binary from the first of `$LAYERX_BIN`, `build/bin/layerx`, and `layerx` on `PATH`; runs `layerx emulator provision` into a scratch profile directory; creates four real signing keys with `layerx key create`; starts `layerx emulator up --protocol-version 3` (the protocol version production runs and `layerx program deploy` signs) on the loopback address the buyer profile names, prefunded against the published sequencer trust anchor; waits for `GET /healthz` to report `ready`; and terminates the emulator and deletes the scratch profile when the run ends, including on failure.

Every `LAYERX_EMULATOR_*` input is then derived from that run instead of being hand-set:

| Input | Derived from |
|---|---|
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_ASSET` | the `authority.asset` of a real seeding transfer receipt read back from `GET /v1/receipts/{id}` |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_SOURCE` | `agent:<did>:main` for the key `layerx key create reference-buyer` produced |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_SELLER`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MERCHANT` | the canonical account identifiers `GET /v1/state` reports for those DIDs |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_SELLER_ACCOUNT`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` | `agent:<did>:main` for the seller and merchant keys, the human-API `destination` the offer advertises in `extra.layerx.account` |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_CURRENCY` | the `money.currency` the seeding quote echoed, advertised in `extra.layerx.currency` |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MARKETPLACE_RECEIPT_DIGEST` | the verified merchant checkout receipt, passed directly to the marketplace buy step |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MARKETPLACE_PROGRAM_ID`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MARKETPLACE_LISTING_ID` | one value per run, reused across the deploy, list, and buy steps |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_TOKEN`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_PAYMENT_KEY`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MERCHANT_CHECKOUT_KEY`, `LAYERX_EMULATOR_MARKETPLACE_KEY` | operating-system randomness, fresh for every run |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_WEBHOOK_PUBLIC_KEYS_JSON` | a generated Ed25519 key pair; the run publishes only its public key |
| `LAYERX_EMULATOR_PRICE` | `1000`, the one value that is a seller's own choice rather than protocol material |

Any of those variables that is already set in the environment is used verbatim, so an owner can override any single input. `LAYERX_EMULATOR_SEED_FILE` skips provisioning and starts the emulator from an existing seed, reading the trust anchor published beside it. `LAYERX_CREDENTIAL_STORE` defaults to `file` with a per-run passphrase so the run needs no operating-system keyring; set `LAYERX_CREDENTIAL_STORE` and `LAYERX_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE` to use your own credential storage.

Both scenarios run buyer payment, merchant checkout, and marketplace deploy, list, and buy. `--scenario beta` expects the `LAYERX_TESTNET_*` inputs, including the actual seller and merchant account references and advertised currency. `LAYERX_EXAMPLE_ENDPOINT` overrides the hosted endpoint every profile carries, so the same runner can be pointed at a beta cluster gateway URL.


## Building and checking against real receipts

Install the locked Node workspace with `npm ci`. From a clean checkout, provide `PAXEER_X_REFERENCE_APP_ARTIFACTS` as an absolute manifest filename in an owner-only directory outside the checkout, then run `node platform/examples/build-reference-apps.mjs`. This one build compiles the actual SDK and three middleware packages, builds the CLI, and builds the marketplace guest through that CLI. The private manifest binds the checked-out revision and hashes every compiled Node output, the CLI, and the guest.

Provide an owner-only external `PAXEER_X_EVIDENCE_DIR` and run `node platform/examples/qualify-reference-apps.mjs`. The default scenario is emulator; `PAXEER_X_REFERENCE_APPS_ENVIRONMENT=beta` selects the configured testnet and requires its authentic account and credential inputs. The check consumes the prebuilt artifacts, creates disposable service state under its evidence directory, and checks the actual released API resource, merchant order receipt, and separate marketplace deployment/listing/purchase receipts. Missing artifacts, authority, or successful receipts fail the run. It reports the receipt verifier's actual `sequencer-signed` level.

`LAYERX_EXAMPLE_STATE_ROOT` optionally places standalone seller and merchant retained state outside their project directories. Leaving it unset preserves the standalone applications' declared state paths.

//! `layerx-indexer`: a durable, decoded history of both halves of the network.
//!
//! The LayerX half follows a relay/archive node's public synchronization and
//! history protocol and decodes every canonical receipt with the frozen
//! `layerx-wire` decoder into both the 15-field activity receipt and the
//! 21-field 402LXP receipt. The Paxeer half walks EVM blocks, receipts and
//! logs plus CometBFT `tx_search` pages, decoding ERC-20 and pointer
//! transfers, native value transfers, bank and tokenfactory typed events,
//! LayerX anchor string events and every precompile ABI event found in the
//! configured ABI directory. Everything lands in one SQLite file with
//! checkpointed cursors and reorg rollback to a configured finality depth.

//! Hosted webhook delivery for `LayerX` journey, payment, approval and program
//! events.
//!
//! Deliveries are signed with Ed25519 under the published scheme in
//! [`scheme`], which is the exact scheme the shipped middleware and framework
//! integrations verify, so an unmodified integration consumes hosted deliveries.
//! They are ordered per subject, retried with bounded deterministic backoff,
//! dead-lettered when attempts are exhausted, and replayable from stable
//! cursors. Delivery state is honest: nothing is reported as delivered without
//! an accepting status observed from the developer's own endpoint, and no fact
//! is presented above `unverified` without the receipt digest that established
//! it.

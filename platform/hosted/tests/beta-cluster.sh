# LayerX beta cluster bring-up and teardown.
#
# Usage:
#   beta-cluster.sh up [--boundary-checks]
#   beta-cluster.sh down
#   beta-cluster.sh render
#   beta-cluster.sh images
#   beta-cluster.sh publish-images <check|dry-run|push|promote|self-test> [publisher options]
#
# publish-images names the mode of platform/hosted/tests/publish-images.sh on behalf of its caller: check and
# self-test reach no registry, dry-run resolves the release binding and writes the publication plan, push
# publishes the immutable revision tag of every image and promote repoints the release and the moving beta
# tags once every published digest verifies. Options after the mode are forwarded to the publisher unchanged.
#
# Inputs (environment variables, all optional unless stated):
#   LAYERX_BETA_KUBECONFIG              owner cluster kubeconfig; unset selects a disposable local kind cluster
#   LAYERX_BETA_CLUSTER_NAME            kind cluster name (default layerx-beta)
#   LAYERX_BETA_IMAGE_REGISTRY          registry prefix images are pushed to for an owner cluster; unset loads
#                                       the locally built images into the kind nodes
#   LAYERX_BETA_BUILDER_ENVIRONMENT_DIR optional hermetic builder root filesystem (regular files and directories
#                                       only, entrypoint bin/layerx-build) published into the
#                                       layerx-program-builder-release volume the program registry mounts. Unset,
#                                       up constructs that root filesystem itself from the committed recipe with
#                                       platform/hosted/registry/builder-environment/build-env.sh and uses the
#                                       rootfs of the constructed entry, which needs docker and an uncommitted
#                                       change free programs/vendor and recipe tree
#   LAYERX_BETA_BUILDER_ENVIRONMENT_CACHE_DIR  directory the constructed builder environments live in, one entry
#                                       per committed recipe tree, reused by a later up and not deleted by down
#                                       (default build/builder-environment)
#   LAYERX_BETA_SEQUENCER_KEY_FILE      PEM ed25519 private key of the beta sequencer; generated when unset. Its
#                                       32-byte seed is the node's sequencer key, so the node, the receipt
#                                       authority, the gateway and the registry share one sequencer identity
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_FOUNDRY_BIN      directory holding the pinned forge and cast that
#                                       interop/deploy/mirror/deploy-ethereum-mirror.sh needs to compile and deploy
#                                       the Ethereum mirror archive contract (default /root/.foundry/bin). Nothing
#                                       else in the bring-up uses Foundry: custody (0x…1013) and the checkpoint
#                                       anchor (0x…1014) are native chain modules configured in the Paxeer genesis,
#                                       and every Paxeer transaction is signed by platform/hosted/paxeer/evm.py
#   LAYERX_BETA_FAUCET_HOST             public faucet hostname (default faucet.paxeer.network)
#   LAYERX_BETA_DEVELOPER_HOST          public developer hostname (default dev.paxeer.network)
#   LAYERX_BETA_RELAY_HOST              public relay/archive hostname (default archive.paxeer.network)
#   LAYERX_BETA_RELAY_UPSTREAM          comma-separated public HTTPS relay/archive origins the beta relay reads
#                                       canonical history from; unset leaves the colocated canonical availability
#                                       log of the sequencer node as its only source
#   LAYERX_BETA_RELAY_SUBMISSION_UPSTREAM  comma-separated public HTTPS endpoints the relay forwards original
#                                       signed activities to (origin, /v1/activities or /rpc). Cluster-internal
#                                       addresses are refused by the relay address policy in
#                                       platform/relay_archive/protocol.py, so this endpoint has to be a public
#                                       one; unset leaves POST /v1/activities without a forwarding destination
#                                       and the bring-up records the missing owner input
#   LAYERX_BETA_RELAY_PEER_SEED         comma-separated public HTTPS relay/archive peer-discovery seeds; unset
#                                       keeps peer discovery disabled
#   LAYERX_BETA_KIND_CNI                calico (default, enforces NetworkPolicy) or kindnet
#   LAYERX_BETA_READY_TIMEOUT           seconds to wait for every journey to report ready (default 900)
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIN_FREE_GIB            free disk required before building the images of a local cluster
#                                       bring-up (default 24)
#   LAYERX_BETA_IMAGE_MIN_FREE_GIB      free disk required by `beta-cluster.sh images`, which builds the image
#                                       set without creating a cluster or loading it into kind nodes; a job
#                                       that only builds and publishes images sets its own bound here
#                                       (default LAYERX_BETA_MIN_FREE_GIB)
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_X402  optional overrides of the five first-party adapter conformance
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_AP2   suites derived from interop/specs/conformance, whose identifier,
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_UCP   vector count and SHA-256 come from the very vector files the
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_VISA_TAP  adapter tests read, as
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_FIAT  '<suite-identifier>,<vector-count>,<suite-sha256>'. No upstream
#                                       publishes a suite for UCP, Visa TAP or the fiat provider callbacks
#                                       (interop/specs/vendor/CONFORMANCE.md), so unset means derived from
#                                       this checkout and a declared value pins an imported suite instead
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_HTTP  optional overrides of the three first-party transport binding
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_MCP   suites, as '<suite-sha256>'; unset derives the digest from
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_CONFORMANCE_A2A   interop/specs/conformance/transport-<binding>, and the binding
#                                       version and specification digest are derived from
#                                       interop/specs/vendor/x402/transports
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_AP2_KEYS        optional JSON counterparty trust roots that pin real external
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_AP2_ASSETS      counterparties: the AP2 mandate issuer keys and asset bindings, the
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_VISA_AGENTS     Visa TAP agent registry keys and merchant targets, and the fiat
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_VISA_TARGETS    provider callback keys. Unset, the bring-up generates them for this
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_FIAT_PROVIDERS  testnet's own test clients and names them layerx-beta-*
#                                       (interop/deploy/gateway/README.md)
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_X402_SUPPORTED  optional overrides of the two in-cluster trust roots, which default
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_UCP_PAYMENT_HANDLER  to this cluster's own facilitator declaration and the UCP
#                                       payment handler of the vendored UCP revision
#   LAYERX_BETA_INTEROP_MANIFEST_FILE   optional interop gateway manifest that overrides any rendered field
#                                       (interop/deploy/gateway/README.md)
#   LAYERX_BETA_TESTNET_PORT            host ports of the testnet, gateway and faucet port-forwards
#   LAYERX_BETA_GATEWAY_PORT            (defaults 19443, 19444, 19445)
#   LAYERX_BETA_FAUCET_PORT
#   LAYERX_BETA_HUMAN_WEB_PORT          443 (default) or empty. The browser origin of the human web application
#                                       is https://paxportwallet.com and carries no port, so the
#                                       passkey ceremony configuration, the human service allowed origin and
#                                       human/apps/web/e2e/software-authenticator.ts only accept it on 443, and
#                                       the owner adds `127.0.0.1 paxportwallet.com` to /etc/hosts and
#                                       trusts the beta internal CA. Set it empty on a host where
#                                       human/apps/web/e2e/run-production-browser.sh serves that same origin from
#                                       its own authbind listener, which leaves the forward and its readiness
#                                       gate out; any other value is refused
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_PORT               host port of the reference ramp port-forward (default 19459)
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_WORKER_ID          reference ramp worker identity (default layerx-beta-ramp-1)
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_FEE_LIMIT          LayerX activity fee limit of the ramp operator (default 1000)
#   The reference fiat ramp is optional: when no LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_* variable is set the bring-up records
#   one missing owner input naming every ramp input and leaves the ramp image, workload, port-forward and
#   sandbox journey out; when some are set it refuses to start and names each one still missing; when all
#   are set it brings the ramp up. Values:
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OPERATOR_PRINCIPAL_ID, LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OPERATOR_DID,
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OPERATOR_SIGNER_KEY_HANDLE, LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT,

#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_GATEWAY_KEY_FILE, LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_PAXEER_CUSTODY_TOKEN_FILE,
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_QUOTES_FILE. The sandbox journey inputs LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_CUSTOMER_TOKEN,
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OFF_GRANT_JSON, LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_ON_ACCOUNT_SEQUENCE and
#   LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OFF_RECEIVER_SEQUENCE are recorded as missing inputs when unset; setting any of them,
#   or LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_ON_QUOTE_ID or LAYERX_BETA_RAMP_OFF_QUOTE_ID, also asks for the ramp
#   LAYERX_BETA_TEST_AUTH_TOKEN_FILE    identity session token for the smoke source; when unset the bring-up
#                                       provisions a principal for the source DID in the identity service with
#                                       a generated ed25519 signer key and mints its session
#   LAYERX_BETA_TEST_SOURCE_DID         smoke source DID (default did:layerx:beta:<random>)
#   LAYERX_BETA_TEST_DESTINATION_DID    smoke destination DID (default did:layerx:beta:<random>, provisioned too)
#   LAYERX_BETA_TEST_AMOUNT             smoke move amount in the node asset (default 1)
#   LAYERX_BETA_QUALIFICATION_NODE_URL  overrides for the qualification runner component URLs
#   LAYERX_BETA_QUALIFICATION_AGENT_URL
#   LAYERX_BETA_QUALIFICATION_HUMAN_URL
#   LAYERX_BETA_QUALIFICATION_PAXEER_URL
#   LAYERX_BETA_FORBIDDEN_CHAIN_ID      refuse contract transactions on this chain id, including disposable clusters
#   LAYERX_BETA_STATUS_PUBLISH_URL      https endpoint of the separately operated status publisher that the
#                                       layerx-testnet-status-publisher CronJob PUTs the testnet status to;
#                                       unset drops that CronJob from the applied manifests and reports the
#                                       variable as a missing owner input
#   LAYERX_BETA_EXPLORER_PROBE_PROGRAM  optional override of the program the explorer index probes before it
#                                       serves; unset reads the program of the reference escrow deployment
#                                       the bring-up publishes to the program registry
#   LAYERX_BETA_EXPLORER_NAMING_PROGRAM optional override of the naming program the Human web application
#                                       resolves names through; unset reads the program of the reference
#                                       naming deployment the bring-up publishes to the program registry
#   LAYERX_BETA_KEEP_TOOLS              set to 1 to keep the pinned kind/kubectl downloads on teardown
#
# Mirror publisher inputs. The bring-up always publishes every LayerX batch archive to an EVM chain; it
# additionally publishes to Solana when the Solana inputs below are set, and mirrors to the EVM chain alone
# when none of them is, recording the Solana inputs as a missing owner input. The publisher and its signer
# are containers of the layerx-node pod, so they reach the node LNI socket and the signer socket over pod
# volumes and need no host paths. The publisher keys live in the layerx-mirror-signer Secret this script
# generates and are served by interop/crates/layerx-mirror-signer under the fixed handles
# mirror/ethereum/beta and mirror/solana/beta, so no owner-operated signer service is involved.
#
# Solana mirror inputs (optional as a group: set all of them to mirror to Solana, none to mirror to the EVM
# chain only; setting some but not all is refused by name):
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_URL   two independent Solana JSON-RPC backends the publisher reaches a
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_URL_SECONDARY      strict majority across
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_CA_FILE            PEM trust anchor for both Solana endpoints
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_TOKEN_FILE         bearer token file of each Solana endpoint
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_SECONDARY_TOKEN_FILE
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_KEYPAIR_FILE           64-byte Solana keypair file of the publisher; it is
#                                       the Ed25519 key material the mirror signer serves and must be the
#                                       publisher the solana-mirror deployment record names
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_DEPLOYMENT_FILE        optional deployment record of the solana-mirror
#                                       program carrying every field solana-deployment.json requires; unset
#                                       builds and deploys the program with deploy-solana-mirror.sh and
#                                       writes the record from that deployment
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_DEPLOY_RPC_URL         endpoint deploy-solana-mirror.sh broadcasts the program
#                                       deployment through (default LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_RPC_URL); the
#                                       Solana CLI cannot send a bearer token, so this endpoint must carry
#                                       its own credential in its URL
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_SOLANA_TOOLCHAIN_BIN          directory holding the pinned solana, solana-keygen and
#                                       cargo-build-sbf used to build and deploy the program
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL when set, the mirror publishes to an owner EVM chain instead of the
#                                       in-cluster Paxeer chain and additionally requires
#                                       LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_ETHEREUM_RPC_URL_SECONDARY,

#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_ETHEREUM_KEY_FILE             0x-prefixed 32-byte secp256k1 private key of the
#                                       Ethereum publisher; unset generates one and keeps it in the

#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_ETHEREUM_SIGNER_PUBLIC_KEY    when set, the compressed secp256k1 key the Ethereum
#                                       publisher key must carry; the bring-up refuses a mismatch
#   LAYERX_BETA_MIRROR_PUBLISHER_GAS_WEI             gas the bring-up tops the Ethereum publisher up to
#                                       before the first publication (default 1000000000000000000)
#
# The trusted-boundary services (node with core boundary, receipt authority and agent boundary; identity;
# Paxeer chain with its boundary) are built from the repository, applied before the testnet, gateway,
# registry and developer manifests, and bound together in this order: the Paxeer chain starts with the
# generated deployer address and the custody and anchor module genesis, the node bootstraps its genesis with
# the registry, custody and anchor precompile addresses its manifest carries as settlement inputs on chain 125
# through the loopback relay, anchor-guarantors.sh registers and activates the node's guarantors in the anchor
# module through the Paxeer boundary, and the same settlement inputs are published as the layerx-node-settlement
# ConfigMap the guarantors read. No Solidity contract is deployed for custody, checkpoints, bonds or challenges.
#
# Two reference programs are deployed through the program registry deployment ingress before the explorer
# observation is published: programs/sdk/rust/examples/escrow, whose deployment record carries the program
# the explorer index probes before it serves, and programs/sdk/rust/examples/naming, whose program id is
# published as the naming-program key of the layerx-explorer-index ConfigMap and bound into the Human web
# container as LAYERX_EXPLORER_NAMING_PROGRAM. Both are built for wasm32-unknown-unknown from this
# repository, so that Rust target has to be installed.
#
# The explorer index resolves names by signing noncommitting reads of that naming program as its own chain
# identity. The bring-up generates that ed25519 key with the other secrets, admits did:layerx:<public key>
# to the node's identity file in the same fresh-genesis append that admits the Human owner, and publishes
# the seed and the sequencer public key in the layerx-explorer-index Secret. It is not an owner input.
#
# Boundary checks (--boundary-checks) additionally read the inputs of
# platform/hosted/gateway/tests/hosted-boundary.sh and platform/hosted/webhooks/tests/fault-injection.sh.
